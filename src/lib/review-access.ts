 * v1.166 — who may read post-shoot peer reviews.
 *
 * The promise made to crew on the form is: *the people you rate, and every
 * other colleague, never see who said what.* That promise is only as good as
 * this gate, so it lives in one tiny module with its own tests and is called on
 * the SERVER in every route that can return review content. Hiding a menu item
 * is not access control.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT tied to `role === 'ADMIN'`: the console has several admins
 * and the operator named exactly who reads what. An admin who is not on the list
 * gets the same 403 as anyone else.
 *
 * `REVIEW_CONTENT_READER_EMAILS` / `REVIEW_ACTIVITY_READER_EMAILS`
 * (comma-separated) override the defaults without a code change — but each
 * REPLACES its list rather than extending it, so the set is always exactly what
 * one place says it is. Adding the operator back to content therefore takes a
 * deliberate env change, which is the guarantee the form's notice relies on.

 * who runs the system, sits on the crew list, and is often the producer being

 *
 *   content  → the messages, the scores, the names. Managers only.
 *   activity → did it go out, did anyone answer, is anything stuck. No content.

 * Both lists fail CLOSED: an env var set to junk falls back to these defaults
