# Operations Log — Production Booking

A running journal of infrastructure events, fixes, and operator actions on
the self-hosted Portainer deployment at `probook.xtec9.xyz`. Newest first.

## 2026-06-26 · v1.100.3 — Episode Type "Event" for the EVT outlet

Added a single-char `E` program (`Event · งานอีเวนต์ / Staff`) to the EVT outlet
in data.ts → it shows in the Episode Type picker for Event-team bookings (the
picker = outlet's single-char programs; EVT now has L/S/A/T + E). Scoped to EVT
(not the universal EPISODE_TYPE_PROGRAMS), so other outlets don't see it.
episodeId handles it (type slot is `[A-Z0-9]{1,4}`). This deploy also carries the
dead-code cleanup from the chore entry below. tsc 0 · 150 tests. NOTE (pending):
deploy + verify the EVT Episode Type picker shows "Event".

---

## 2026-06-26 · chore — dead-code cleanup (no version bump, no deploy)

Ops asked to remove anything unused/broken to reduce confusion. Ran a dead-code
audit (21-agent find→adversarially-verify workflow; refuted 4 false positives).
Removed only **zero-runtime-risk** dead code — nothing the running app executes,
so live behavior is unchanged (still 1.100.2; the cleanup ships with the next
real deploy):
- `findBookingByProductionId` (booking-lookup.ts) — unused single-lookup; only
  the batched `findBookingsByProductionIds` is used.
- `PART_SIZE_MAX_BYTES` (wasabi.ts) — unused constant.
- `clearFootageSheetCache` (footage-sheet.ts) — only the deleted diagnostic used it.
- 4 one-off scripts: `scripts/{inspect-drive-outlets,inspect-footage-sheet,test-ot-pdf,verify-booking-rule}.ts`
  — run-once diagnostics/tests, unreferenced by start.sh / package.json / CI.

**Kept on purpose** (flagged needs-confirm — real capabilities that are merely
off/idle, NOT dead): the whole footage matcher subsystem (runFootageSync + worker
+ /api/internal/footage/sync + the scan button) — idle because FOOTAGE_LOG_SHEET_ID
is unset, but works if configured; Wasabi (off by default); the email
RESEND_FROM/SENDGRID_FROM fallbacks (email is sensitive, can't verify the prod
env doesn't set them). **Flagged but NOT touched (infra config, not code):**
`UPLOAD_DIR` + `POSTGRES_*` in .env.production/docker-compose (app never reads
them, but they're docker-level — clean up separately if wanted). tsc 0 · tests pass.

---

## 2026-06-26 · v1.100.1 — "สแกนหา footage" button (trigger the matcher on-demand)

Admin-only button in UploadSection (/upload) next to Refresh → calls
`GET /api/internal/footage/sync` immediately (instead of waiting for the ~10-min
worker), shows scanned/matched/parsed_no_booking/unparsed counts. For use right
after moving NAS files into the boxes. Gated to admin (the endpoint 401s
otherwise). tsc 0 · tests pass.

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE** (sha-555b432 → then sha-1282866 with the v1.100.2
message fix). Clicking the button returns 200 in ~3s — but it surfaced that the
prod footage matcher is **IDLE**: `runFootageSync` returns
`{ ok:false, reason:"FOOTAGE_LOG_SHEET_ID env var not set — worker idle" }`. So
the auto-match-to-inventory-sheet routine has never been running on prod (the
sheet env was never set). **Ops decided to leave the matcher OFF** — the per-EP
folder links (v1.100.0) already give the producer footage per EP, resolved live
from the path, so the inventory-sheet matcher isn't needed. The scan button stays
(harmless; reports "idle" honestly after v1.100.2; works if the matcher is ever
enabled by setting FOOTAGE_LOG_SHEET_ID + a log sheet).

---

## 2026-06-26 · v1.100.0 — per-EP footage links on the producer page (NAS-moved footage)

Ops moved footage off the NAS into the Drive boxes (same structured tree the app
creates — Production ID in the path, the "green" case) and wants the producer to
open each EP's footage folder from inside the app. Added a per-EP **"📁 footage"**
link on `/dashboard/[id]` (Episode IDs card). It resolves each EP's folder by its
DETERMINISTIC path **read-only** (`findEpisodeFolderUrls` in google-drive.ts —
fuzzy outlet/program, exact booking/EP, never creates), so it works for NAS-moved
footage too (no Upload row needed). New endpoint `GET /api/bookings/[id]/ep-folders`
(read-scope = canViewBooking), fetched non-blocking after page load.

No new routine needed: the existing footage matcher (`runFootageSync`, supervised
worker, ~10 min) already walks `DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT` and matches by Production ID —
faster than the requested hourly. The per-EP link resolves the path live each
view, so NAS footage shows the instant it's in the box. tsc 0 · 150 tests pass.

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE** as `sha-4c48cb8` (after a pre-deploy review fixed
the episodeId→Episode.id keying + read-only auth). `/api/version` → 1.100.0.
Verified: `GET /api/bookings/<CEA booking>/ep-folders` resolved all 4 EP folders
to real Drive folder ids; `import-producers` → created 1 (แพท), and
`/api/producers?outlet=NWS` lists แพท in the Producer column.

⚠️ DEPLOY-COLLISION (2 sessions again): right after my 1.100.0 deploy stuck, the
OTHER session redeployed `sha-90ac7d4` (v1.99.1) over it — live flipped back to
1.99.1 and my first re-deploy 500'd (stack busy mid-deploy). Re-fired the
redeploy once the stack freed → 1.100.0 held. Reiterated: do not run two sessions
on the same Portainer stack.

The v1.100.0 entry above bundled the v1.99.2 แพท producer add.

---

## 2026-06-26 · v1.99.2 — News producer แพท

Added แพท (ภาวิกา ขันติศรีสกุล, phawika.k@, TSD00056) to `OUTLET_PRODUCERS` as a
**Producer** for outlet NWS. Sheet title is "Project Coordinator" but ops asked
for Producer, so `position: 'Producer'` (lands in the Producer column; the
invariant test still passes). Needs `POST /api/admin/import-producers` after deploy.
tsc 0 · tests pass. NOTE (pending): deploy + import (Portainer was logged out).

---

## 2026-06-25 · v1.99.1 — Notes preserve line breaks on the producer dashboard

One-line CSS fix: `/dashboard/[id]` rendered booking Notes in a plain `<p>`, so
the newlines the operator typed collapsed to spaces (run-on paragraph). Added
`whitespace-pre-line` to match the admin page (which already had it).

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE** as `sha-85d2398` (bundles v1.99.0 + v1.99.1).
`/api/version` `1.98.0` → **`1.99.1`**. Notes verified on the CEA booking's
`/dashboard/[id]`: computed `white-space: pre-line`, 14 newlines preserved,
rendered multi-line (320px) instead of one run-on line.

---

## 2026-06-25 · v1.99.0 — add Outlet Event (EVT) + PM + their teams (17 producers)

Ops request: add two outlets — **Event** (`EVT`, sort 10) and **PM** / Project
Management Office (`PM`, sort 11) — plus their team members from the outlet-DB
sheet (tab User: 7 Event, 10 PMO). Data-only change: `OUTLETS` (data.ts) +
`OUTLET_PRODUCERS` seed (outlet-producers.ts, 17 entries) + `OUTLET_FOLDER_BY_CODE`
(EVT→EVENT, PM→PM). Everything downstream is data-driven (outlet picker, producer
dropdown via /api/producers, folders via outletDriveFolderName → `10 · Event` /
`11 · PM`) so no wiring needed. tsc 0 · 149 tests pass (+invariant test: all seed
outlet codes resolve, EVT/PM have a selectable program, 7+10 members, unique emails).

**POST-DEPLOY STEP (DONE):** ran `POST /api/admin/import-producers` (ADMIN) after
deploy → `{ total: 35, created: 17, updated: 18 }`. The 17 Event/PM people are
now in the User table.

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE** in `sha-85d2398` (with v1.99.1). Adversarial
review (5 agents) caught one real bug pre-deploy — PM "Project Coordinator"
position didn't match the `/co.?produc/i` co-producer regex, so coordinators
would land in the Producer column; fixed by extracting `isCoProducer`
(`/co.?produc|coordinator/i`) to `src/lib/producer-role.ts`, shared by the route
+ a new invariant test. Verified live via `GET /api/producers`: **EVT** →
producers [มุก, ลูกหมู, อาร์ม], coProducers [นาเดียร์, พลอยดี, มิกซ์, แอม];
**PM** → producers [6 Managers], coProducers [ต้นอ้อ, มะเหมี่ยว, เพิรล, ใยไหม]
(the 4 Coordinators correctly in Co-Producer). Ponytail review flagged ~10
trimmable lines (low-value test asserts + one invented program) — left as-is,
cosmetic.

---

## 2026-06-25 · v1.98.0 — list-view (full date + EP title + sort) + Category removal (non-AGN)

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE** (by a second concurrent session that had Portainer
browser access — the original session left this "deploy pending: Portainer
unreachable"). Set stack-125 `IMAGE_TAG=sha-4d5c3d0` (prev `sha-b249931`/v1.97.0)
+ pullImage → redeploy; `/api/version` `1.97.0` → **`1.98.0`** through the recreate
window. Verified live on /my-bookings: rows show full date `Thu 25 Jun 2026`, the
first-EP title appended (`[AGN]Awesome Skills Project — Wrap-up Long-form`,
`[TSS]…on Location — บริษัท โบทานิก้า…`), and chronological order (25 Jun before
30 Jul). ⚠️ Two sessions were live on this repo+stack simultaneously — work was
preserved (v1.94.1 ancestor intact, v1.95–98 built cleanly on top) but this is
the clobber-risk scenario; consolidate to one session.

Ops request: list rows show full date + first-EP title; sort Producer & My Bookings by
date; drop the redundant booking-level Category radio for non-AGN (derive from per-EP).

**Verified on a LOCAL container** (docker compose, AUTH_DISABLED, localhost:3003) — the
first time these changes ran in a real runtime, not just unit tests:
- Home list rendered full dates ("Fri 10 Jul 2026"…), first-EP titles ("— ดีล X ตอนสปอนเซอร์"),
  and chronological order (Jul10→…→Aug12).
- `POST /api/bookings` (non-AGN, EP contentType ADVERTORIAL, payload category ORIGINAL_CONTENT)
  → persisted **ADVERTORIAL** (derived); all-OC → ORIGINAL_CONTENT. AGN path unchanged.
- Producer feature (v1.96/1.97) also re-verified: import-producers → /api/producers?outlet=NWS
  returns the 3 new News producers (ข้าวฟ่าง/หนามเตย/พีช).

Adversarial review (4-agent workflow) found only 1 low nit (dead `format` import in page.tsx) — fixed.

**LOCAL-DEPLOY GOTCHA hit:** `docker compose up -d --build app` returned before the
container actually recreated (a bg poll loop broke early) → tested old code once; and a
BuildKit cache error ("lease does not exist") needed `docker builder prune -af` +
`docker pull node:20-alpine` before the rebuild succeeded. Lesson: after a local rebuild,
confirm the container actually recreated (and the behavior changed) before trusting a test.

Bundles with still-undeployed v1.95.0–v1.97.1. tsc 0 · 145 tests. Merge → image `sha-<merge>`.
**PROD deploy still pending** (Portainer unreachable from assistant): stack 125
`IMAGE_TAG=sha-<merge>` + redeploy pullImage → `/api/version`=1.98.0 → run import-producers.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.97.1 — add-episodes review fixes (pre-deploy)

Adversarial review (11-agent workflow) of the still-undeployed v1.95–1.97 changes
found 5 real bugs, all in the new add-episodes feature; fixed before deploy:
1. dup Episode rows on retry/concurrency → transactional re-read + skip + seq from max
2. missing AuditLog → log `booking.episodes_added`
3. stale Google Calendar after adding EPs to CONFIRMED booking → `updateCalendarEventDetails`
4. (= #1, durable angle) @@unique([bookingId,episodeId]) DEFERRED — needs monitored db-push
5. producer free-text mode sticky across edit sessions → reset `producerCustom`

tsc 0 · 141 tests. Image will be `sha-<merge>`. **Deploy still pending** (Portainer
unreachable from assistant: both browser-extension and Mac `curl` get connection
refused to `thestandard.fortiddns.com:9000`; user must deploy from their network).
Deploy = stack 125 `IMAGE_TAG=sha-<merge>` + redeploy pullImage → `/api/version`=1.97.1
→ run `POST /api/admin/import-producers`.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.97.0 — News producer พีช + agenda camera count

1. Added the 3rd News producer **พีช** (papassara.p@, TSD00256) to `OUTLET_PRODUCERS`
   — email was finally filled in the outlet-DB sheet. All 3 requested (ข้าวฟ่าง,
   หนามเตย, พีช) now in. **Post-deploy:** run `POST /api/admin/import-producers`.
2. `/calendar` agenda + selected-day rows now show `🎥 N` (+ `🎙 N`) camera count
   (Block Shot → `🎥 TBC`). Display-only; `/api/bookings` already returns the counts.

Bundles with still-undeployed v1.95.0 + v1.96.0. tsc 0 · 141 tests. Merge → image
`sha-<merge>`. **DEPLOY (pending — Portainer unreachable from assistant browser):**
stack 125 `IMAGE_TAG=sha-<merge>` + redeploy pullImage → `/api/version` = 1.97.0 →
run import-producers.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.96.0 — News producers + admin producer-reassign at any status

Two ops-requested changes (bundled with the still-pending v1.95.0 deploy):
1. Added 2 News Program producers to `OUTLET_PRODUCERS` (ข้าวฟ่าง suthamat.t@,
   หนามเตย trinuch.i@). **Post-deploy step:** run `POST /api/admin/import-producers`
   (admin) so they upsert into the User table and appear in the News Producer
   dropdown. (3rd person พีช/ปภัสรา held — email cell blank in the outlet-DB sheet.)
2. Admin can now reassign a booking's Producer at ANY status via `/admin/[id]` Edit
   — producer field became a per-outlet dropdown (`/api/producers?outlet=`) + free-text
   fallback; PATCH `/api/bookings/[id]` now also accepts `producerEmail`.

tsc 0 · 141 tests pass. Merge to main → image `sha-<merge>`. **DEPLOY (still pending,
same blocker as v1.95.0 — Portainer unreachable from assistant browser):** stack 125
`IMAGE_TAG=sha-<merge>` + redeploy pullImage → verify `/api/version` = 1.96.0 → then
run import-producers.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.95.0 — link existing project episodes onto a confirmed AGN booking

Feature (not infra): `/admin/[id]` gains a **"เพิ่ม EP จาก project"** button (AGN +
projectId only) to attach more episodes to a booking at any status, incl.
CONFIRMED — for directors adding shoots (Highlight, interview) after approval.
Picks from the project Sheet (source of truth); **never mints EP IDs** (that
foot-gun was removed in v1.35.17). New endpoint `POST /api/admin/[id]/add-episodes`
+ pure planner `src/lib/link-episodes.ts` (4 tests). tsc 0 · 141 tests pass.

Merged to main as `254d52a` → image `ghcr.io/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking:sha-254d52a`.
Deploy: Portainer stack 125 — set `IMAGE_TAG=sha-254d52a` + redeploy (pullImage).
First real use: add `Highlight` + `สัมภาษณ์ ผอ.ชาอูริติ` EPs onto AGN-260625-LOC-01
(PP-26-025) after the producer adds them to the project in Producer Dashboard.

## 2026-06-24 · v1.94.1 — Content Agency: restore the category layer above the Project box, DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE

Ops correction to v1.94.0: that cut dropped the AGN category layer entirely
(Project box directly under `09 · Content Agency`). But PMC pre-created
**Advertorial** and **Event / Forum** boxes under Content Agency (confirmed live
at drive folder 1gXPrIBV7WoNQ3cmRIFVMUqhGQsw76WPv — both empty, Jun 18). So
restore the category layer: an AGN booking now lands in
`09 · Content Agency/<Advertorial | Event / Forum>/<Project ID · name>/<EP id · title>/<camera>/`,
routed by `booking.category` (Event → "Event / Forum", Advertorial →
"Advertorial"). Only `shootFolderLayers()`'s AGN branch changed: program layer =
`programFolderName({category})` (the pre-v1.94 byte-exact category strings),
booking layer = the Project box (now nested in the category instead of replacing
it). EP folders + everything else unchanged. The upload path hint updated to show
the category layer. tsc 0 · 137 tests pass.

Deployed `sha-1cf26d3` (prev `sha-d6876ac`); `/api/version` `1.94.0` → **`1.94.1`**.
**Verified live**: the AGN booking PP-26-016 upload path hint now reads
`[outlet]/[Advertorial·Event]/[Project ID · โปรเจค]/PP-26-016-S02 · 2/CAM-A/` —
category layer back above the Project box. Confirmed against the live Drive where
PMC pre-created `Advertorial` + `Event / Forum` under `09 · Content Agency`.

### Migration: CEA กรุงเทพ calendar event → REQUESTED booking
Separately, migrated one Google Calendar event (`aqodjpcndf5erptaa9rqfb41lo` on
the production calendar) into Probook as **REQUESTED** per the operator's ask
("ตั้งเป็น Requested ไว้ รอผมแก้"). It's a Content Agency Advertorial for client
CEA (producer ไนซ์). "CEA กรุงเทพ" isn't a project name, so confirmed the link
with the operator → **PP-26-025 (Awesome Skills, CEA)**; auto-picked episodes
`L01` (Wrap-up Long-form) + `S15` (Voxpop - BKK) to match the event scope (1 Long
+ 1 Voxpop short). Created via `POST /api/bookings` with a full payload mirroring
the wizard (the prior July-migration 500 was bad/missing data, not a code bug —
a valid payload returns 201). Result: **AGN-260625-LOC-01**, REQUESTED, 25 Jun
2026 08:00–17:00, ม.กรุงเทพ, 2 cam / 1 mic / van, all calendar detail in notes.
NOT approved (no calendar event or folders created). Operator edits/approves.

## 2026-06-24 · v1.94.0 — Content Agency footage by Project → EP, DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE

Content Agency (AGN) gets its own Drive layout: the **Project box**
`<Project ID · name>` (e.g. `PP-26-008 · ชื่อโปรเจค`) sits directly under
`09 · Content Agency` and plays the role other outlets' show name does, then EP
folders keyed by the **project EP ID** (`PP-26-008-L04 · title`), then cameras.
There is **no per-booking `<Production ID>` folder** for AGN — every booking of a
project drops its EPs under the one Project box. EP folders use the project EP ID
(not `EP01`) because AGN `sequence` restarts at 1 per booking and would collide as
siblings. Every other outlet is unchanged
(`<show>/<Production ID · job>/EP01 · title/CAM-A`).

Implementation: `shootFolderLayers()` returns the program + per-booking layer
AGN-aware (AGN → Project box + empty booking layer); `resolveShootFolder` skips
the booking level when `bookingFolderName===''`; `buildEpisodeFolderName(ep,
{useEpisodeId})` leads with the episodeId for AGN. Wired into approve / the
prep-folders worker / upload-init, plus the read-side (folder links + footage
report labels), the /upload EP picker + path hint, and the `_SHOOT.txt` name
(`_SHOOT-<Production ID>.txt` for AGN since the Project box is shared). The
Production Team landing drive stays keyed by Production ID (it's a NAS drop zone,
identity = the shoot). tsc 0 · 137 tests pass.

Ceiling: the Project box is matched by its `<Project ID · name>` string, so if a
project's name snapshot changes between bookings a duplicate box could appear
(names are normally stable). AGN footage uploaded before v1.94 stays in the old
category/Production-ID layout (not migrated).

Deployed `sha-d6876ac` (prev `sha-cd83312`). `/api/version` flipped `1.93.0` →
**`1.94.0`** through the recreate window (~3×502). **Verified live** on the real
AGN booking `AGN-260706-STD-01` (project `PP-26-016 · LIFE Beauty Demo Short
Clip`, 3 EPs): the /upload EP picker shows the **project EP IDs**
`PP-26-016-S02 · 2 / -S03 · 3 / -S04 · 4` (not EP01/02/03), and the path hint
reads `[outlet]/[Project ID · โปรเจค]/PP-26-016-S02 · 2/CAM-A/` — i.e. the
Project box with **no Production-ID layer**, exactly the spec.

**Pre-deploy adversarial review** (workflow, 10 agents) raised 2 — both checked
by hand and dismissed: (1) "AGN with missing projectId silently falls back" —
`projectId` is immutable + required for AGN at creation, so it can't be cleared;
the fallback only covers hypothetical legacy rows, where the per-booking layout
is correct graceful behavior, not a crash. (2) "approve route doesn't select
episodeId → folder-name mismatch" — FALSE: the approve query uses Prisma
`include` (returns ALL scalars incl. episodeId), proven by the existing
`episodes[0].title` read on the same query; approve-time and upload-time produce
identical AGN folder names. No code change needed.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.93.0 — per-EP footage folders (multi-EP shoots no longer mixed), DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE

Deployed `sha-cd83312` (prev `sha-59ea209`). `/api/version` flipped
`1.92.2` → **`1.93.0`** through the recreate window (~11×502 for ~65s — the
exact gap the v1.92.2 retry survives). **Verified live:** of 28 CONFIRMED
bookings, **9 are multi-EP** so the feature bites real data; `/api/upload/status`
returns the new `{epSlots, flatCams, files}` shape; opened
`/upload?bookingId=…` for multi-EP `TSS-EXE-261204-L-01` (2 EPs) → the
**"ตอน / Episode"** picker renders with `EP01 · TBC` / `EP02 · TBC`, episodes
carry `id`+`sequence` for the FK, and the path hint reads
`…/TSS-EXE-261204-L-01 · [ชื่องาน]/EP01 · TBC/CAM-A/`. tsc 0 · 135 tests pass.

**Pre-deploy adversarial review** (workflow, 13 agents) caught 3 real issues,
all fixed in `cd83312` before the deploy: (1) 🔴 the Wasabi key was
episode-agnostic → same camera+filename across EPs would overwrite on Wasabi —
added an ASCII `EP01` segment to `buildStoragePath` mirroring the Drive path
(Wasabi is off by default but the collision is now closed); (2) the "อัปครบ"
badge mixed legacy (`episodeId=null`) and EP-tagged uploads in one count →
split `/api/upload/status` into `epSlots`/`flatCams` buckets, the UI picks by
whether the booking has episodes (no null/non-null collision); (3) `/upload/init`
now rejects an `episodeRowId` sent for a booking with no episodes instead of
silently dropping it.

Multi-episode bookings now get a per-episode folder layer between the booking
folder and the camera folders: `<Production ID · job>/EP01 · title/CAM-A/`.
Applies to **all** bookings (single-EP gets `EP01` too, for consistency); a
booking with no episodes keeps the old flat `<booking>/<camera>/` layout. New
`buildEpisodeFolderName({sequence,title})` → `"EP01 · title"`. Wired into all
three folder-creation paths — approve (CONFIRMED pre-create, EP×camera for every
episode), the hourly prep-folders worker (incl. the Production Team landing
drive), and upload-time (`ensureUploadFolderPath` takes `episodeFolderName`).
The /upload page gains a **"ตอน / Episode"** picker (shown only for ≥2-EP
shoots) and tags `Upload.episodeId` on every file. Read-side followed: the
per-camera folder links + the "ส่งงาน" footage report group by **(EP × camera)**,
and the "อัปครบ" badge counts `cameraCount × episodeCount` slots so it isn't
falsely green when some EPs are still missing (extends the v1.92.1 bug-#3 fix
along the EP axis). tsc 0 · 135 tests pass.

Ceiling (no migration): files uploaded before v1.93 (`episodeId=null`) stay in
their old flat folders — old footage isn't moved, only new uploads use the EP
layer. A pre-v1.93 booking that was fully uploaded flat may show 🟡 briefly
because the badge now counts per-EP slots.

---

## 2026-06-24 · v1.92.2 (+v1.92.1) — multi-agent bug-review fixes, DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE

Deployed `sha-59ea209` (bundles v1.92.1 + v1.92.2 — all 5 confirmed bug-review
findings). Fixes: 🔴 **tier lockout regression** (producer/crew/coordinator
couldn't open their own `/dashboard/[id]` or `/bookings/[id]/edit` — added to
ALWAYS in `src/lib/tiers.ts`, owner-auth already enforced at data layer);
🟠 upload badge over-counted non-CAM folders as cameras (`/api/upload/status`
now counts only `CAM-*`); 🟡 prep-folders Production-Team errors uncounted
(`prodTeamErrors`); 🟡 `completeWithRetry` retried permanent FAILED ~2.5 min
(`/complete` now returns `permanent` flag → client stops; transient lag still
retries). 133 tests pass, tsc clean.

**Verified live:** polled `/api/version` → flips `1.92.0` → **`1.92.2`** through
the container-recreate window (≈12×502 for ~70s — the exact gap bug #4's retry
now survives). Post-deploy smoke: `/admin /my-bookings /upload /dashboard` all
200; `/api/upload/status` deployed + responds. Tier-lockout fix verified at unit
level (regression test in the shipped commit) — can't forge a producer JWT as
admin to exercise the middleware redirect live.

**Deploy gotcha observed:** Portainer stack-125 `Env.IMAGE_TAG` read
`sha-43a8cc7` (v1.91.0) even though the running container reported `1.92.0` —
the v1.92.0 git/redeploy's tag override hadn't persisted back to the stack Env.
Setting `IMAGE_TAG=sha-59ea209` explicitly + `pullImage:true` deployed cleanly;
`/api/version` confirms 1.92.2. (Redeploy fetch CDP-aborted at ~28s while
pulling, as usual — the redeploy still completed server-side.)

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.92.0 — inline edit episode title (any status, ID locked)

Deployed `sha-97f7f15`. /admin/[id] Episode IDs card gets a "✎ แก้ชื่อตอน" button
→ edit titles inline at any status incl. after approval (CONFIRMED). IDs stay
locked (reuses PATCH /api/bookings/[id], which only touches titles). Admin could
already do this via the Booking Details edit mode, but it was on a different card
and non-obvious. **Verified live** on a CONFIRMED booking: edited TBC →
"ทดสอบ v1.92" → saved, episodeId unchanged (TSS-GEB-261211-L-01), reverted clean.
Producer self-edit stays REQUESTED-only (a follow-up if producers should edit
titles post-approval too).

## 2026-06-22 · v1.91.0 — sound/mic queue filter (completes the sound-mgmt tier)

Deployed `sha-43a8cc7`. /admin queue gains a "🎙️ เฉพาะงานที่ต้องการเสียง/ไมค์"
toggle (jobs with `micCount > 0`). Locked ON for the sound-mgmt tier; a free
toggle for the rest. Console-tool header links (รายงาน/Routine/+New) hidden for
sound-mgmt. Client-only, reuses `resolveTier`/`tierAllows`. **Verified:** toggle
renders, admin not redirected. NOTE: 27/28 CONFIRMED jobs have micCount>0, so the
filter barely narrows (most shoots use mics) — correct per "needs mics", but if a
stricter "dedicated sound team" cut is wanted, key it off `crewRequired` (a sound
role) instead of micCount (would need that field added to the queue fetch).

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.90.0 — role×position UI tiers (per-tier menus + page access)

Deployed `sha-0d25849`. Five tiers from (role × position): admin / coordinator /
sound-mgmt (position "Senior Sound Engineer") / producer (position ~"producer") /
crew (everyone else). `src/lib/tiers.ts` (`resolveTier`/`tierAllows`/`tierHome`,
7 unit tests) is the single source used by BOTH the Nav (hide items) and
`middleware.ts` (block pages → redirect to the tier's home; never `/api`).
`position` added to the JWT; pre-v1.90 tokens (no position) keep the role-based
gating until they refresh — **no false lockouts**. `getUserTier()` feeds the Nav
server-side.

**Verified live:** admin (narasit.k) lands on `/`, full menu, `/admin` + `/upload`
→ 200 (no redirect), `/api` works. Tier distribution across all 50 users is
correct: admin 4, producer 13, crew 31, coordinator 1, sound-mgmt 1 — none
mis-bucketed.

**Remaining follow-up:** sound-mgmt sees the FULL queue; the "filter to sound/mic
jobs only" view is not built yet.

## 2026-06-22 · v1.89.0 — footage file report + "ส่งงาน" deliver email

Deployed `sha-9a88506`. Schema add (`Booking.deliveredAt`/`deliveredBy`,
nullable) applied by `start.sh` `prisma db push` on boot. Build pipeline runs
`prisma generate` before `next build` so the new fields type-check in CI.

- **Footage report** — `GET /api/upload/report` + `buildFootageReport()` /
  `listFolderFiles()` (Drive `videoMediaMetadata` → duration + resolution).
  Shown per-camera on the upload page (name · size · duration · resolution).
- **"ส่งงาน"** — `POST /api/bookings/[id]/deliver`: emails the Producer + CCs the
  sender the file report + links, records `deliveredAt`/`deliveredBy` + audit.
  Re-send allowed. Producer-less booking → self + warn.

**Verified live:** report endpoint + UI render CAM-A's two B011R003 files with
size + **duration 5:28** + resolution (2160×3840 / 1080×1920); ส่งงาน button
present. Deliver NOT test-fired — the booking's producer is a real person
(`sarut.a@thestandard.co`); left the first real send to the operator.

## 2026-06-22 · v1.88.0 — prep-folders also creates landing folder in Production Team

Deployed `sha-cef02e0`. The hourly prep-folders worker now, for today's confirmed
shoots, ALSO pre-creates a flat shoot folder in the **Production Team** Shared
Drive (`0AGendsFHFQYKUk9PVA`, default; override `DRIVE_PRODUCTION_TEAM_ROOT`) —
`<root>/<Production ID · job>/CAM-A..` — so crew drop NAS footage into an
already-named folder instead of ad-hoc "date + show" folders. New
`ensureFlatShootFolders()`; best-effort (a Production Team error doesn't undo the
VIDEO 2026 prep). **Verified live:** real run → `prodTeam: ok`; Drive shows
`NWS-NDG-260622-S-01 · …` with `AUDIO, CAM-A` in the Production Team root. No
Portainer env needed (drive id hardcoded with env override).

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.86.0 / v1.87.0 / v1.87.1 — prep-folders worker + 500GB cap

Deployed `sha-24bf78e`. (Deploy note: the API redeploy fetch CDP-times-out at
45s while Portainer pulls; if the stack IMAGE_TAG env doesn't change afterward,
the redeploy didn't apply — re-fire and verify the tag flips. Hit this once here.)

- **v1.86.0** — new `prep-folders` worker (supervised in start.sh, **ON by
  default** — set `PREP_FOLDERS_WORKER_ENABLED=0` to disable). Hourly hits
  `GET /api/internal/prep-folders/run`, which pre-creates the VIDEO 2026
  destination boxes (CAM-A.. folders) for bookings shooting TODAY (Bangkok TZ,
  CONFIRMED/COMPLETED). Idempotent, no file moving. `src/lib/prep-folders.ts`,
  `scripts/prep-folders-worker.js`. (The "detect + move from Production Team
  drive" half is deferred — landing folders are named "date + show", no
  Production ID, and there's often no matching booking; cross-Shared-Drive move
  itself was tested working = instant metadata move, no re-upload.)
- **v1.87.0** — per-file upload cap 100GB → **500GB** (`MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`).
  Drive allows 5TB; chunks go browser→Google direct. Verified: init a 200GB file
  → accepted. Caveat unchanged: no resume across tab reload → huge interrupted
  uploads restart from 0 (NAS→Drive sync stays the path for the very largest).
- **v1.87.1** — fixed prep-folders missing today's shoots. `Booking.shootDate`
  is `@db.Date` (date-only); `bangkokTodayRange` had offset the bounds by -7h and
  the date-truncated 17:00Z `end` made `lt` exclude today → dry-run returned
  today=0. Fixed to midnight-UTC of the Bangkok calendar date. **Verified
  end-to-end:** dry-run finds NWS-NDG-260622-S-01 (CAM-A, AUDIO); real run created
  them; Drive shows `AUDIO · CAM-A` in the booking folder. Diagnosed via the
  exec-API DB probe.

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.85.0 — upload-status badges + free-text Event producer

Deployed `sha-b277c16`. Two ops-requested tweaks:
- /upload job list now shows a per-booking badge (🔴 ยังไม่อัป / 🟡 อัปบางกล้อง
  n/cameraCount / 🟢 อัปครบ) from the new `GET /api/upload/status?bookingIds=`
  (groupBy completed cameras, counts only). Verified live: NWS-NDG-260622-S-01
  → 🟢 อัปครบ (2); empty bookings → 🔴 ยังไม่อัป.
- Event shoots (`shootType==='Event'`, non-AGN) use the free-text Producer
  Name/Phone/Email again instead of the per-outlet dropdown (1-line
  `useProducerDropdown` change). 119 tests pass.

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.84.0 — Drive uploads attributed to the real uploader

Deployed `sha-b5a7f67` via the Portainer API redeploy (same mechanism as below).
The footage upload path now impersonates `session.email` (domain-wide delegation)
so Drive shows the actual person as the file/folder creator instead of the fixed
`GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` (narasit.k). If the uploader isn't a Shared Drive
(VIDEO 2026) member, the first folder op returns 403/404 → `isDriveAccessError`
→ fall back to the default subject so uploads never break (just attributed to
narasit.k). `getDriveWriteAuth(subject?)` + `subject` threaded through
ensureUploadFolderPath / upsertTextFile / createResumableUploadSession; new
`src/lib/drive-access.ts` (+ unit test). Verified live: init as narasit.k → 200
+ Drive session (impersonation works); 119 tests pass.

Access-control note for the operator: **blocking an email** already works today —
deactivate the user (`active=false`) in /admin/permissions and they can't log in
(`auth.ts` returns `/login?error=disabled`). Controlling who can open the footage
folders on Google Drive is a Workspace/Shared-Drive membership task (the app can't
change Drive ACLs) — but v1.84 ties "upload as yourself" to Shared Drive membership.

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.81.0 / v1.82.0 / v1.83.0 — footage upload UX + completion robustness

All three built via GHCR push→main and deployed via the Portainer API redeploy
(`PUT /api/stacks/125/git/redeploy?endpointId=2`, `IMAGE_TAG`→sha, `pullImage:true`;
CSRF from a GET's `X-CSRF-Token` response header). Running image now
`sha-885a605` (v1.83.0); `/api/version` reports 1.83.0.

- **v1.81.0** — folder upload: `webkitdirectory` button + folder-aware drag-drop
  (`webkitGetAsEntry` recursion); OS cruft filtered. Verified live: button +
  `webkitdirectory` input present.
- **v1.82.0** — per-camera Drive folder links on the upload/task page. New
  `GET /api/upload/folders` + `getDriveParentFolderId()`. Verified: CAM-A →
  real Drive folder `1v6CiYJ…`.
- **v1.83.0** — `completeWithRetry`: `/api/upload/complete` now retries 10×
  through transient 5xx / non-JSON / network errors (idempotent server-side).

**Incident (self-inflicted) + recovery:** the v1.82.0 redeploy's container
recreate window (≈12:22–12:23) coincided with a real 5.7GB upload's final
`/complete` call → 502 → the (then) non-retrying client showed
`Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE"` and marked the finished upload FAILED even
though all bytes were already in Drive. **Recovery:** re-called `/complete`
(idempotent) for that upload → COMPLETE + Drive link + sheet row. **Root-cause
fix = v1.83.0** so a deploy/blip during `/complete` can't fail a finished
upload again. **Lesson:** redeploys are safe vs in-flight chunk PUTs (those go
browser→Google directly) but NOT vs an upload's `/complete` landing in the
recreate window — check for active uploads before redeploying, or rely on the
new retry.

**Cleanup:** removed the assistant's test-upload rows (`claude-*-test.bin`,
`xhr-verify.bin`, `multichunk-test.bin`, `cors-verify.bin`) + their FootageLog
via a scoped `prisma deleteMany` run through the Portainer Docker **exec API**
(`POST …/containers/{id}/exec` + `…/exec/{id}/start`, `Tty:true`, `WorkingDir:/app`)
— a clean alternative to driving the console xterm. Left the user's own FAILED
attempts (SUB/CLIP/New Digest) untouched.

---

## 2026-06-22 · v1.80.1 — fix Upload Footage CORS (Drive stuck at 0% retry 3/4)

**Symptom (operator-reported):** every footage upload to Drive stalled at 0%,
auto-retried 4× (amber "retry 3/4"), then failed. All files, all sizes.

**Root cause:** the browser PUTs each Drive chunk cross-origin to
`googleapis.com`. We created the resumable session **without an `Origin`
header**, so Drive accepted the bytes (HTTP 200) but omitted
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on the chunk-PUT *response* → the browser blocked
it as a CORS violation → `xhr.onerror` → retries exhausted → 0%. The CORS
*preflight* returned ACAO, which masked the problem; only the real PUT response
lacked it. Reproduced directly against live Drive: no-Origin init → response
ACAO `null`; with-Origin init → ACAO set. Drive accepted the bytes either way.

**Fix (code, needs redeploy):** send the browser `Origin` on session init.
`src/app/api/upload/init/route.ts` reads `request.headers.get('origin')`
(fallback `NEXTAUTH_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`) and passes it to
`createResumableUploadSession`, which now sets it as the `Origin` request
header on the resumable-init PATCH. No env/schema change required.

**Operator action:** redeploy with the new image. If the front proxy strips the
`Origin` header, ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://probook.xtec9.xyz` is set in the
stack so the fallback matches the browser's real origin exactly (a mismatch
re-breaks CORS).

**✅ DEPLOYED + VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-22 ~11:30** — pushed `edf23f4`→main, GHCR
built `sha-edf23f4` (green), redeployed Portainer stack 125 via the API
(`PUT /api/stacks/125/git/redeploy?endpointId=2`, `IMAGE_TAG`→`sha-edf23f4`,
`pullImage:true`; CSRF token read from a GET's `X-CSRF-Token` response header
since the cookie is httpOnly). Container `production-booking-app` now runs
`sha-edf23f4`, version endpoint reports 1.80.1. `NEXTAUTH_URL` confirmed
`=https://probook.xtec9.xyz` in the stack env (fallback safe). **End-to-end
verified in the real browser:** init'd a real upload on booking
NWS-NDG-260622-S-01 and did the exact cross-origin chunk PUT to googleapis.com
that used to fail → **HTTP 200** with `drive#file` metadata (no CORS error);
reserved test slot cleaned up via the cancel endpoint (200).

---

## 2026-06-19 · v1.77.0 — ops reliability (backup + dead-man + version)

**New DB model `SystemHeartbeat`** — auto-applied by `prisma db push` on
container start; no manual migration.

**Automated backup (opt-in).** Set in the stack env to enable:
- `BACKUP_WORKER_ENABLED=1`
- `BACKUP_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=<Drive folder id>` — service account needs **edit**
  access; the daily `pg_dump | gzip` lands here as `backup-<ts>.sql.gz`.
- optional: `BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS` (default 86400000), `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`
  (default 30), `BACKUP_SECRET` (defaults to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`).
- Until enabled, the worker stays dormant (supervisor re-launches harmlessly).

**Dead-man alerts.** Once any worker is enabled and has ticked, a silent stall
> interval+2h fires a throttled Discord+email alert (reuses
`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` / `REMINDER_ADMIN_EMAIL`). External probes can poll
`GET /api/health-summary` (200/503, unauthenticated, no secrets).

**Deploy traceability.** CI now stamps `APP_GIT_SHA` into the image and verifies
the `sha-` tag is pullable before going green (kills the "manifest unknown"
race); `GET /api/version` reports the running version + commit. The build job
summary prints the exact `IMAGE_TAG` to deploy.

**Optional:** `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated) overrides the seed-admin
list; defaults to the original owner when unset.

Compose passthrough for all of the above is already wired in
`docker-compose.portainer.yml`.

## 2026-06-19 · DEPLOYED sha-2a3f403 (v1.73 + v1.74 + v1.75) — VERIFIED LIVE

Bumped stack 125 `IMAGE_TAG=sha-2a3f403` and Pull-and-redeploy'd. Container
`production-booking-app` now running `ghcr.io/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking:sha-2a3f403`
(created 12:11; db healthy). Verified on `probook.xtec9.xyz/admin/rentals`:
universal search box + sortable headers + count (v1.74) and the per-row 📎
document button (v1.75) all render; nav shows คิวงาน/Admin split (v1.73).

**The earlier "manifest unknown" pull failure** was a timing race — the user
hit Pull-and-redeploy while the GHCR build of sha-2a3f403 was still running,
so the tag wasn't pushed yet. No env/typo issue (IMAGE_TAG was already
correct). Fix was simply to wait for the build to finish, then redeploy.

**Still pending:** `DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT` is NOT set, so the 📎 upload returns
"ยังไม่ได้ตั้งค่า DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT" (listing/viewing works). Set it to a Drive
folder id the service account can edit to enable uploads.

---

## 2026-06-19 · v1.75.0 — Admin document attachments → Google Drive

**New optional env `DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT`.** A Drive folder id (My Drive or a
Shared Drive folder) where Admin document attachments land. The app
auto-creates one subfolder per job inside it
(`<DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT>/<หมวด>/<ชื่องาน>`). Until it's set, the 📎 upload button
on Rentals/Purchases/Repairs/Loans returns a clear "ยังไม่ได้ตั้งค่า
DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT" error — listing/viewing still works.

**To enable:** add `DRIVE_DOCS_ROOT=<folderId>` to the stack env. Passthrough
is already wired in `docker-compose.portainer.yml`. The service account
(Drive write auth) must have edit access to that folder. Uses the existing
Drive credentials — no new secret. Server-side upload, 25MB/file cap; does
not touch Wasabi.

---

## 2026-06-18 · v1.71.0 — `AUTH_DISABLED` wired up (was dead config)

**Behavior change, opt-in.** `AUTH_DISABLED=1` now actually bypasses Google
OAuth (`getSession()` returns a seeded ADMIN; `src/middleware.ts` skips the
`/login` redirect). Previously the flag was documented + echoed at boot but no
code read it, so it did nothing.

**Env.** New optional `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` (default `narasit.k@thestandard.co`)
controls which admin the bypass acts as — should match an existing ADMIN user
row so DB-backed reads resolve. Already added to `docker-compose.portainer.yml`.

**⚠️ Prod must keep `AUTH_DISABLED=0`.** The internet-facing
`probook.xtec9.xyz` stack must never set it to 1. Default is off
(`${AUTH_DISABLED:-0}`), requires the exact string `1`, and logs a loud warning
in both the `start.sh` banner and the app runtime when active. No schema change,
no redeploy required beyond the normal image bump.

## 2026-06-18 · v1.70.0 — Footage Drive path → new "VIDEO 2026 [JUL–DEC]" (issue #5)

**Schema change.** One new column `Booking.isBlockShot Boolean @default(false)`
(from v1.67) — applied by `prisma db push` in `start.sh` on the next stack
update. Additive, no data loss.

**⚠️ REQUIRED ENV CHANGE AT CUTOVER (≥ 1 Jul, set in Portainer).** Set
`DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT=0AH7f4FZNrHsOUk9PVA` (the new Shared Drive "VIDEO 2026
[JUL–DEC]"). The code now writes the new tree
`<root>/<NN · Outlet>/<program|category>/<Production ID · job>/<CAM-x>/` into
whatever `DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT` points at. **Sequence: deploy the code, then flip
the env to the new Drive id** — if the env is flipped before the code ships,
uploads land in the new Drive with the OLD layout; if the code ships before the
flip, uploads write the new layout into the OLD (soon-frozen) Drive. PMC freezes
the old "Video 2026" read-only at cutover and has pre-created the outlet +
program boxes; the app creates the shoot + camera folders (pre-create at
CONFIRMED, ensure-create at upload). Wasabi keys are unchanged (ASCII archive,
keyed by Production ID).

**No other env.** Drive write needs the existing service-account + DWD `drive`
scope (already used by the calendar path). The approve-time pre-create is
best-effort (never blocks approval if Drive is down / `DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT`
unset). A critical duplicate-folder bug (asymmetric fuzzy match vs PMC's
numbered boxes) was caught in adversarial review and fixed before ship.

---

## 2026-06-18 · v1.64.0 — Production Admin Space (ADMIN-only back-office modules)

**No schema change, no new env.** Back-office modules (equipment/loans/repairs/
rentals/purchases/vendors) moved to a new ADMIN-only page `/admin/production-space`
(top-nav "Admin Space" menu) and locked to ADMIN throughout: 10 API routes
`requireConsole`→`requireAdmin` + a middleware redirect bouncing non-admin page
hits on `/admin/{module}` back to `/admin`. Coordinator/Manager/Support lose
access to these tools.

**Deploy — ✅ DONE + VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-18 ~17:22.** Fast-forwarded
`feat/production-admin-space` → `main` (254aad9..cb1d1ae) → docker-build + CI
green → image `sha-cb1d1ae` (bundles v1.63.0 + v1.64.0). Redeployed via Portainer
stack 125 → Pull and redeploy (Re-pull image ON). `production-booking-app` now
runs `sha-cb1d1ae`, state=running, db=healthy; verified `/login`→200 (LAN :3001 +
public probook.xtec9.xyz), `/api/bookings`→401 (DB connected), `/`→307. Both
v1.63.0 (`start.sh prisma db push` added `bookings.special_equipment` — first
deploy carrying it to prod) and v1.64.0 are live.

**DNS-intermittent incident (the ~1h deploy blocker).** Office DNS
`192.168.21.221` returned SERVFAIL ("server misbehaving") so the host could
resolve neither `ghcr.io` (image pull) nor `github.com` (git-stack compose
clone) → "Failed to pull images of the stack" / "Unable to clone git
repository". It is FLAKY, not down (deploys succeeded both before and after the
window); a Pull-and-redeploy retry once it recovered just worked. Durable fix if
it recurs: server/network admin repairs `192.168.21.221` or points the Docker
host's resolver at a public DNS (1.1.1.1). Note: `daemon.json` `dns:` does NOT
affect the daemon's own registry pulls (only containers) — the host resolver is
the lever. Portainer UI lives at `http://thestandard.fortiddns.com:9000`
(the `docker.xtec9.xyz` Cloudflare tunnel was returning 530).

---

## 2026-06-18 · v1.63.0 — Special equipment + camera-overload warning + producer self-edit (schema: `bookings.special_equipment`)

**Schema change.** One new column on `bookings`: `specialEquipment String[]`
(defaults to empty array; existing rows unaffected) — applied automatically by
`prisma db push` in `start.sh` on the next stack update. Additive, no data loss.
(Note: the column already landed on `origin/main` via the v1.62 merge; this
release wires the rest of the feature to it.)

**No new env, no post-deploy action.** The 9-camera limit is the constant
`CAMERA_LIMIT` in `src/lib/booking-overlap.ts`; the producer-edit change email
reuses the existing `sendEmail` path (no new provider). The warning is advisory
only (never blocks a booking); producer-edit is server-gated to the booking
owner while `status==='REQUESTED'`. Deploy: build image from
`feat/producer-edit-special-equipment` (or after merge to main) → bump
`IMAGE_TAG` → Pull and redeploy.

---

## 2026-06-18 · Workspace data migration into prod + serial-date import fix

**What ran.** Imported the remaining Google-Sheets datasets into the prod DB by
exec'ing the importer inside the running container (Portainer → container
`production-booking-app` → Console → `/bin/sh`), the proven path:
`npx tsx scripts/import-workspace.ts <vendors|fixed-assets|rentals|purchases|repairs> --commit`.
Final DB counts (verified via `prisma .count()`): vendors=5, equipment=1719
(1248 fixedAssets + 471 loanable), rentalJobs=221, purchaseItems=93,
repairTickets=3, equipmentLoan=0.

**Bug found + fixed mid-migration.** `rentals` crashed first run:
`prisma.rentalJob.findFirst()` → `Could not convert argument value … DateTime
"+046035-01-01"`. Root cause: `parseSheetDate` fell through to `new Date(s)`,
and a raw **Google Sheets serial date** (`46035` = an unformatted date cell)
was read by V8 as **year 46035**. Fix: convert bare 5-digit serials via the
1899-12-30 epoch and clamp results to 1990–2100 (out-of-range/NaN → null).
Committed to `main` as `f527cab` (GHCR built `sha-f527cab` clean — a consolidated
main image = all v1.62 code + this fix, available for the next redeploy).

**In-container hotpatch (so no redeploy was needed just for a CLI script).** The
running container is `sha-3c8ef1e` (pre-fix script). Patched its
`/app/scripts/import-workspace.ts` in place with an atomic, pattern-guarded
`node` script (heredoc → `/tmp/fix.js`; `if (!s.includes(before)) exit(1)` before
writing), then re-ran `rentals` → inserted=221 updated=3 skipped=58.
⚠ This hotpatch lives only in the current container and **reverts on the next
redeploy** — which is fine, because `sha-f527cab` already has the fix baked in.

**NOT migrated: loans.** `import-workspace.ts loans --commit` is deliberately
deferred until the external Apps Script that auto-writes the sheet's "Equipment
Loans" tab is retired (two writers would collide). equipmentLoan table is empty.

---

## 2026-06-18 · v1.62.1 — equipment loan/return ↔ status-sync fix (deploy)

**Code fix, no schema/env change.** Equipment.status is now DERIVED everywhere via
`src/lib/equipment-status.ts` (`reconcileEquipmentStatus`), and UI loans resolve
`equipmentId` from the typed tag/name server-side so the AVAILABLE↔ON_LOAN sync
actually engages (it was dead for every UI-created loan). See CHANGELOG [1.62.1].

**Deploy steps:** committed on `feat/unified-workspace`; built a new image via
`gh workflow run docker-build.yml --ref feat/unified-workspace` (workflow_dispatch);
then Portainer → stack `production-booking` → Environment variables → set
`IMAGE_TAG=sha-<new commit>` → Save settings → Pull and redeploy → **Update** (compose
still pulled from `main`, unchanged). Verify live: loan an AVAILABLE item via
/admin/loans typing its catalog name/tag → /admin/equipment shows it ON_LOAN; mark
returned → back to AVAILABLE.

## 2026-06-17 · Fix — reminder worker env never reached the container

**Symptom.** After deploying v1.62.0 (`sha-b68edc6`) the reminder worker logged
`[reminders] REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED is off — exiting` on a loop and never sent a
Discord/email digest, even though the env vars were "added" in Portainer.

**Cause.** This stack is **git-based** (compose pulled from
`github.com/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking`). Portainer stack env vars
are only used for `${VAR}` substitution *inside the compose file* — they are not
injected into containers. `docker-compose.portainer.yml` had no passthrough for
the reminder vars, so they could never reach the app container regardless of what
was set in Portainer. (Container `docker inspect` confirmed: none of
`REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED` / `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` / `REMINDER_ADMIN_EMAIL` present.)

**Fix.** Added a reminder env passthrough block to the app service in
`docker-compose.portainer.yml` (mirrors the footage/calendar worker pattern):
`REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED`, `REMINDERS_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS`, `REMINDERS_SECRET`
(defaults to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`), `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `REMINDER_ADMIN_EMAIL`,
`INVOICE_AGING_DAYS`, `SHOOT_GEAR_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS`. Committed to `feat/unified-workspace`.

**To enable on prod (Portainer → stack `production-booking` → Environment variables):**
- `REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED=1`
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=<webhook>`  ← secret, Portainer only, never in git
- `REMINDER_ADMIN_EMAIL=narasit.k@thestandard.co`
Then **Redeploy from git repository** (re-pulls the updated compose + applies env).
`IMAGE_TAG` stays `sha-b68edc6` — no image rebuild needed (the worker code already
ships in that image). Verify container logs show `[reminders] worker started` and
`[reminders] detected=… discord=true`.

**Prevention.** Any new supervised worker's env MUST be declared in the compose
`environment:` block — setting it only in Portainer stack env is a silent no-op for
git-based stacks.

---

## 2026-06-17 · v1.62.0 (phases 2–4) — Finance + equipment/loans/repair UI + importer + MCP tools

**No new infra.** Same `prisma db push` schema (the 8 tables were already in the
v1.62.0 phase-0 entry below). Adds admin pages + CRUD APIs under `/admin/{equipment,
loans,repairs,rentals,purchases,vendors}` and `/api/admin/*`. Finance writes
(rentals/purchases) gated to **ADMIN**; everything else to console tiers. No new
required env for these to run.

**Data migration (one-time, manual, off-deploy).** `scripts/import-workspace.ts`
pulls the legacy sheets into the new tables. Run from the app container or any
box with the repo + service-account env:
```
npx tsx scripts/import-workspace.ts all            # DRY RUN — prints counts only
npx tsx scripts/import-workspace.ts all --commit   # actually writes
```
Requires the service account (`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_*`) to have **read** access
to both sheets. Sheet ids default to the equipment sheet (`1U5Yhd…`) and finance
sheet (`1MQMu…`); override with `EQUIP_SHEET_ID` / `FINANCE_SHEET_ID` and the
`*_TAB` envs if tab names differ (the script auto-matches tab names case-insensitively
and prints the tab list if it can't find one). Idempotent (upserts). **⚠ Before
importing loans:** find + retire whatever external tool writes the sheet's
"Equipment Loans" tab (likely a bound Apps Script) or it will fight the DB.

**Build note (2026-06-17).** A concurrent editor's in-progress "Producer edit"
feature (`/bookings/[id]/edit`, untracked) had a TS error at hand-off time that
would block `next build` (next.config does not ignore TS errors). The v1.62.0
workspace code itself typechecks clean (verified: `tsc --noEmit` shows errors only
in that foreign WIP file) and 99/99 tests pass. Resolve that file before building.

## 2026-06-17 · v1.62.0 — Unified workspace phase 1: auto-planning + reminder engine (schema + new worker + new env)

**Schema change (additive, no data loss).** New columns on `bookings`:
`equipmentNote`, `rentalGearNote`, `itinerary`, `assignedEquipmentIds` (all
nullable / default []). Eight new tables: `equipment`, `equipment_loans`,
`equipment_loan_items`, `repair_tickets`, `vendors`, `rental_jobs`,
`purchase_items`, `document_refs`, `reminders`. All applied automatically by
`prisma db push` in `start.sh` on the next stack update. Existing rows
unaffected; the new tables start empty (phase 2–4 imports populate them).

**New supervised worker.** `start.sh` now launches a third worker
(`scripts/reminders-worker.js`) alongside calendar-reconcile and footage-sync.
It stays **dormant unless `REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED=1`** (same dormant-by-default
pattern as footage-sync), so the stack update is safe with no behavior change
until you flip the env. It polls `GET /api/internal/reminders/run` once per
interval (default 24h) → scan + dispatch (Discord + email digest).

**New env to set when turning reminders on:**
- `REMINDERS_WORKER_ENABLED=1` — turn the worker on (default off)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — Discord channel webhook (primary push channel)
- `REMINDER_ADMIN_EMAIL` — recipient for the daily email digest
- Optional tuning: `INVOICE_AGING_DAYS` (7), `SHOOT_GEAR_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` (3),
  `LOAN_DUE_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` (2), `REPAIR_AGING_DAYS` (7),
  `WARRANTY_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` (30), `REMINDERS_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS` (86400000),
  `REMINDERS_SECRET` (falls back to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`)

**Email digest caveat.** The worker has no logged-in user, so Gmail-OAuth is
NOT available to it — the email digest only sends if a non-interactive provider
is configured (`SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS` or `RESEND_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_API_KEY`).
Discord works with just the webhook URL, no email provider needed.

**Post-deploy check.** After redeploy, container logs should show
`[reminders] worker started` (if enabled) and a `[reminders] supervisor` line.
Verify the scan without sending:
`curl 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/internal/reminders/run?dryRun=1' -H 'x-reminders-secret: <secret>'`.
Normal deploy: new `sha-<commit>` tag + Update the stack.

---

## 2026-06-17 · v1.61.0 — Special equipment + camera-overload warning (schema: `bookings.special_equipment`)

**Schema change.** One new column on `bookings`: `specialEquipment String[]`
(defaults to empty array; existing rows unaffected) — applied automatically by
`prisma db push` in `start.sh` on the next stack update. Additive, no data loss.

**No new env, no post-deploy action.** The 9-camera limit is a constant
(`CAMERA_LIMIT` in src/lib/booking-overlap.ts) — change it there if the studio's
camera inventory changes. The warning is advisory only (never blocks a booking).
Normal deploy: new `sha-<commit>` tag + Update the stack.

---

## 2026-06-14 · v1.59.0 — Outlet producers (schema: `users.nickname`, `bookings.co_producer`/`co_producer_email`)

**Schema change.** `User.nickname` + `Booking.coProducer` + `Booking.coProducerEmail`
(all nullable) — applied by `prisma db push` in `start.sh` on next stack update.

**Post-deploy action (one-time).** Go to /admin/permissions → click
**"↧ Import producers (sheet)"** (ADMIN) to upsert the outlet Producer/Co-Producer
roster (src/lib/outlet-producers.ts, from the ops sheet) into User accounts +
producerOutlets tags. Without this, the per-outlet Producer/Co-Producer dropdowns
in the booking form stay empty (form falls back to free-text). Idempotent;
re-run after editing the seed. To add/remove producers later without a deploy,
edit producerOutlets per user on /admin/permissions.

**No new env.** Normal deploy: new `sha-<commit>` tag + Update the stack.

---

## 2026-06-14 · v1.56.0 — Routine planner (schema: `bookings.isRoutine` + `bookings.routineGroupId`)

**Schema change.** Two new columns on `bookings`: `isRoutine Boolean @default(false)`
and `routineGroupId String?` (+ index) — applied automatically by `prisma db push`
in `start.sh` on the next stack update (additive; existing rows get false/null).

**What.** New `/admin/routine` bulk-generates recurring weekday bookings for
daily shows (THE STANDARD NOW etc.), skipping weekends + Thai holidays + custom
dates, as REQUESTED bookings tagged isRoutine and grouped by routineGroupId.
Routine bookings get a badge, a dedicated /admin tab, and Workspace filter;
they're excluded from the normal /admin status tabs. `GET /api/bookings` gains
`routine=only|exclude` (default includes both — calendar/dashboard unchanged).

**Deploy.** Normal flow — new `sha-<commit>` tag + Update the stack; no new env.

---

## 2026-06-12 · v1.54.0 — Producer-per-outlet tags (schema: `users.producerOutlets`)

**Schema change.** New `producerOutlets String[] @default([])` on `users` —
applied automatically by `prisma db push` on the next stack update
(additive, existing rows get `[]`).

**What.** Users can be tagged as Producer of specific outlets on
/admin/permissions (new column, chip editor). `GET /api/producers` serves
the tags as dropdown data for the booking form's future per-outlet
Producer dropdown. Tags grant no access. Also: Director is now optional
for Content Agency bookings (form-side change only).

**Deploy.** Normal flow — new `sha-<commit>` tag + Update; no new env vars.

---

## 2026-06-11 · v1.51.0 — Booking soft delete (schema: `bookings.deleted_at`)

**Schema change.** New nullable column `deletedAt` on `bookings` — applied
automatically by `prisma db push` in `start.sh` on the next stack update
(additive, no data migration, existing rows stay NULL = visible).

**What.** ADMIN-only soft delete for test/junk queues: 🗑 DELETE on the
/admin cards hides the booking from every web surface (and MCP) while the
row stays in the DB. New 🗑 Deleted tab on /admin lists hidden bookings
with ↺ RESTORE (undelete) and ลบถาวร (the existing v1.44 hard-delete
endpoint, now with its first UI). Soft delete removes the Google Calendar
event and auto-OT rows, same as a cancel.

**Deploy.** Normal flow — point the stack at the new `sha-<commit>` tag and
Update; no new env vars.

---

## 2026-06-10 · v1.49.0 — MCP endpoint (new env vars: MCP_API_KEY / MCP_ACTOR_EMAIL)

**What.** `/api/mcp` lets external AI clients (claude.ai connectors,
Claude Code, Claude Desktop) query the schedule and create/cancel
booking requests. Full setup guide: docs/mcp.md.

**Enable (one-time):** add to the Portainer stack env and redeploy —
- `MCP_API_KEY=` `openssl rand -hex 32` output. **Leave unset to keep
  MCP disabled** (endpoint answers 503; this is the safe default).
- `MCP_ACTOR_EMAIL=mcp@thestandard.co` (audit identity; optional).

**Security posture:** single shared bearer key, staff-level access only
(create/cancel + reads); approve/assign/hard-delete/purge are not
exposed as tools. All writes audit-logged. Rotate by changing the env
and redeploying; share the key only with people allowed to book.

**No schema change.** Deploy = pull `latest` and redeploy the stack.

---

## 2026-06-10 · Test-data purge — deleted all 23 pre-June bookings (v1.44.0 deployed)

**What was done.** Production cleaned to June-only data per narasit.k's
request: hard-deleted every booking with `shootDate < 2026-06-01` — 23
rows, mostly the May test spam (AGN-2605xx, PP-26-006 Yamaha test runs,
mid-May NWS/WLT/KND trials, incl. `TSS-260528-TSL-01`). Each delete went
through the new `POST /api/admin/[id]/delete` (v1.44.0): cascades
episodes + uploads, cleans audit/footage/auto-OT rows, removes the
Google Calendar event best-effort, and writes an `admin.delete_booking`
audit entry (the only trace left, by design).

**Kept (7 bookings, all June):** AGN-260604-STD-01, WLT-260604-L-01,
NWS-260608-L-01/-02 (cancelled), AGN-260610-EVT-01 (cancelled),
PP-26-026-S01 (requested), AGN-260615-LOC-01 (confirmed).

**Verified after purge:** `GET /api/bookings?limit=100` returns exactly
those 7; zero pre-June rows. The Producer Dashboard "Bookings" tab
already held only June rows (the May test rows didn't survive the sheet
restructure), so no sheet cleanup was needed.

**Deploys today (one stack redeploy each):** v1.42.1 → v1.43.0 →
v1.44.0 (`sha-31f5bc6`, includes v1.43.1's Monitor "other" bucket).

---

## 2026-06-10 · v1.42.1→.2 — "ไม่มี episode ที่ถ่ายได้" incident: Dashboard PD→_EPs sync is dead

**Symptom.** Content Agency booking form showed no bookable episodes for any
recent project (e.g. PP-26-025 with 16 non-Published episodes); Sheet Monitor
showed "No EPs" for everything created after mid-May.

**Root cause (sheet side, NOT this app).** The Dashboard's May 2026
restructure moved episode authoring to per-producer **"PD <name>" tabs** with
a new column layout. The sheet's own Apps Script that synced PD rows into
"_EPs" stopped copying new rows — "_Update Log" records them as `skipped`,
and "_EPs Backup 20260511-1202" marks the migration date. "_EPs" is frozen at
~13 legacy episodes (PP-26-013…020). The app read only "_EPs", so new
episodes were invisible.

**Fix (app side, v1.42.2).** `fetchAllEpisodeRows` discovers `PD *` tabs at
runtime and reads them + legacy "_EPs" in one batchGet, resolving each tab's
columns from its header row. Booking form, project dropdown filter, and
Sheet Monitor all use it. (v1.42.1, same day, was an incomplete diagnosis —
header-based column resolution; kept, it's what makes the two layouts work.)

**No schema / env / infra change.** Deploy = pull `sha-ff2ef75` (or `latest`)
and redeploy the stack.

**Follow-up for the Dashboard owner (chonlathorn.j):** the PD→_EPs sync
script can be fixed or retired; the app no longer depends on it. If a new
producer tab is added it must keep the `PD <name>` naming pattern to be
picked up.

---

## 2026-06-09 · v1.42.0 — overnight OT (schema addition)

**What deployed.** OT can now span midnight (CHANGELOG 1.42.0): a "วันที่เลิก"
field on the OT form, calc/validation that span the day boundary, auto-OT from
overnight shoots, and 🌙+N markers across the OT page / review / CSV / PDF.

**Schema change — applied automatically.** Added one column to `ot_records`:
`endDate DateTime? @db.Date` (nullable). The container's existing
`prisma db push --accept-data-loss` on start applies it cleanly — no manual
migration, no data touched. Verify after deploy: a new OT entry with วันที่เลิก =
next day should save (no "end must be after start" error) and show 🌙+1.

---

## 2026-06-09 · v1.41.0 — booking ops feedback (schema additions)

**What deployed.** Batch of ops feedback (see CHANGELOG 1.41.0): required
Estimated Wrap, camera/mic counts + 🎥/🎙 on calendar, 🚐 van flag on calendar
(web + Google), Google Calendar title now patched on time/episode edits, and a
fix for freelancer names duplicating on the calendar (now structured).

**Schema change — applied automatically, no manual step.** Added four columns to
`bookings`: `cameraCount Int?`, `micCount Int?`, `needsVan Boolean default false`,
`freelancers Json?`. All additive/nullable, so the container's existing
`prisma db push --accept-data-loss` on start applies them cleanly (no data loss,
no manual migration). Verify after deploy: `/admin/health` should be green and a
new booking should round-trip the van/equipment fields onto its calendar event.

**Calendar email noise.** `updateCalendarEventDetails` uses `sendUpdates: 'all'`,
so editing a synced booking (time/title/location) re-notifies its guests. This is
intentional — crew must hear about call-time changes — but expect an invite-update
email whenever an admin edits a CONFIRMED booking.

---

## 2026-06-03 · Wasabi browser upload broken — bucket had no CORS

**Symptom.** Drive upload worked end-to-end, but files never appeared in
Wasabi — no object, no "folder". The user's real upload
(`AGN-260604-STD-01/Cam1/S__8429575.jpg`) was sitting as an INCOMPLETE
multipart with zero parts.

**Root cause.** The `video2026hires` Wasabi bucket had **no CORS
configuration** (`GetBucketCors` → `NoSuchCORSConfiguration`). The booking
app uploads browser-direct to Wasabi via presigned multipart `UploadPart`
PUTs; a cross-origin browser PUT requires the bucket to (a) allow the app
origin + PUT method and (b) expose the `ETag` response header so the client
can collect part ETags for `CompleteMultipartUpload`. Without CORS the
browser blocks the PUT outright → multipart never completes → no object.
Drive was unaffected (Google's resumable endpoint sends its own CORS); the
server-side `wasabiPing` passed because server-to-server S3 calls ignore CORS.

**Investigation note — Mimir shares the bucket.** Mimir's media-ingest
config (`ingest_media-video2026hires`) reads `video2026hires` as a SOURCE
bucket using the same Wasabi account. This is **server-side** ingest
(Mimir's backend scans with the access/secret key), which does **not** use
CORS — so adding browser CORS for the booking app cannot affect Mimir's
scan. Mimir's own bucket is `tsdmimir2026` (separate). Account has 3 buckets:
`tsdmimir2026`, `tsdphotographer`, `video2026hires`.

**Fix (applied via S3 API, `PutBucketCors` on `video2026hires` only).**
Previous CORS was empty, so nothing was overwritten:
```json
[{ "AllowedMethods": ["PUT","GET","HEAD"],
   "AllowedOrigins": ["https://probook.xtec9.xyz"],
   "AllowedHeaders": ["*"], "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"], "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600 }]
```

**Verification.** A real cross-origin browser PUT from `probook.xtec9.xyz`
to a presigned Wasabi part URL → **HTTP 200 + readable ETag**
(`video2026hires.s3.ap-southeast-1.wasabisys.com`). Before the fix this PUT
was CORS-blocked. Cleaned up 5 stale booking-app incomplete multiparts
(the user's failed upload + 4 test artifacts); left 13 other-tool
multiparts (AVATR/UNCOVER/rclone) untouched.

**Follow-up idea (not applied — bucket change, needs operator OK).** A
bucket Lifecycle rule to auto-abort incomplete multipart uploads after N
days would prevent orphan accumulation from any failed upload.

---

## 2026-06-02 · v1.36.0 — upload Drive path: existing folders + DWD drive scope + Drive API enable

**Goal.** Make footage upload land in the team's real "VIDEO 2026" Shared
Drive folders (not duplicates), name the booking folder by Production ID +
job name, and drop a `booking-info.txt` per booking. Last piece for the
upload feature to be end-to-end usable.

**Three infra actions before the code change worked:**

1. **DWD scope** — Added `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` to the
   `production-booking@…` service account's Domain-Wide Delegation in Google
   Workspace Admin (Security → API controls → Domain-wide Delegation → edit
   client `106117530552798836735`). It previously had only `…/auth/calendar`.
   DWD matches scopes EXACTLY — `drive.readonly` was a different, unauthorized
   string, which is why the footage worker + inspect script had failed with
   `unauthorized_client`. Code now points read auth at the authorized `drive`
   scope too.

2. **Drive API enabled** — Enabled `drive.googleapis.com` in GCP project
   `production-booking-494605` (number 157610285818). Had never been used
   there, so Drive SDK calls failed with "API … is disabled."

3. **Folder mapping confirmed against live Drive** — real outlet folders:
   `1.NEWS · 2.POP · 3.PODCAST · 4.KND · 5.THE SECRET SAUCE · 6.WEALTH ·
   7.LIFE · 8.SPORT · 9.ADVERTORIAL` (root `0APhGxxryY4pzUk9PVA`). Code matches
   by canonical suffix (ordering-prefix tolerant, prefers numbered). A stray
   bare `Advertorial` folder from the earlier bug was moved to Drive trash
   (recoverable) — it held only 0-byte test placeholders.

**Verification.** Local E2E against live Drive: AGN resolved to the real
`9.ADVERTORIAL` (parent `1_uz_0Ceyp9…`), wrote a readable `booking-info.txt`
with all episodes, cleaned up. After deploy `POST /api/upload/init` → 200.

---

## 2026-05-29 · v1.35.13 — compose never passed Wasabi/footage env vars to the container

**Symptom.** `/api/admin/upload-config` on the running container reported all
`WASABI_*`, `DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT`, and `FOOTAGE_LOG_SHEET_ID` as `MISSING`,
while `drive.hasCredentials` (the pre-existing `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_*`
vars) read fine. Operator had pasted all the new vars into the Portainer
stack env and redeployed — diagnostic still showed MISSING.

**Root cause.** `docker-compose.portainer.yml`'s `app` service `environment:`
block listed only the pre-existing vars. The v1.34.x footage vars and v1.35.x
Wasabi vars were never added to it. Portainer stack env vars only drive
`${VAR}` substitution inside the compose file — they are not injected into
the container unless an `environment:` line references them. So the operator's
pastes were used for substitution against lines that didn't exist → dropped.

**Fix.** Added all 14 missing vars to the `environment:` block, each as
`${VAR:-default}` (values still sourced from the Portainer stack env; no
secret committed). `FOOTAGE_SYNC_SECRET` defaults to `${NEXTAUTH_SECRET}`,
mirroring `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_SECRET`.

**Operator action.**
1. Redeploy the stack on the new commit so the updated compose applies
   (Pull and redeploy — image tag also advances to v1.35.13).
2. Confirm via `https://probook.xtec9.xyz/api/admin/upload-config`:
   `wasabiPing.ok = true`, `summary.wasabiReady = true`.
3. The values already in the stack env carry over — no re-paste needed.
4. To turn the footage worker on later: set `FOOTAGE_WORKER_ENABLED=1` +
   `FOOTAGE_LOG_SHEET_ID=1KMmbPjbRnd6Deb-ct253YMmoINuLgTDnS4Id2lPA5VI`
   (`DRIVE_FOOTAGE_ROOT=0APhGxxryY4pzUk9PVA` already defaulted in compose).

**Rollback.** Revert this commit → compose drops back to the prior
`environment:` block. Harmless; the container just loses the new vars again
(upload returns the actionable `WASABI_NOT_CONFIGURED` error from v1.35.12).

---

## 2026-05-25 · v1.33.0–v1.33.3 prepared on `feat/ot-signature` (not yet deployed)

OT signature workflow built across four phases on a feature branch. Not
merged to `main` — auto-build is gated on this branch's lifecycle, so
production stays on v1.32.2 until merge.

**Schema migration (runs in start.sh before `prisma db push`):**

1. `ALTER TYPE "OTApprovalStatus" ADD VALUE` for `DRAFT`, `SUBMITTED`,
   `REJECTED` (idempotent via `IF NOT EXISTS`).
2. `UPDATE ot_records SET "approvalStatus" = 'SUBMITTED'
   WHERE "approvalStatus" = 'PENDING'` — empties out the old PENDING
   label so `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` can drop it.
3. Additive nullable columns on `users` (`signaturePng` Text,
   `signatureUpdatedAt`) and `ot_records` (`submittedAt`,
   `requesterSignaturePng` Text, `approverSignaturePng` Text,
   `rejectionNote`).

**New runtime deps (auto-installed by Dockerfile `npm install`):**

- `pdf-lib ^1.17.1`
- `@pdf-lib/fontkit ^1.1.1`

**New static assets bundled in the image (`public/fonts/`):**

- `Sarabun-Regular.ttf` (~88KB)
- `Sarabun-Bold.ttf` (~88KB)
- `SARABUN-OFL.txt` (SIL OFL license attribution)

Loaded at runtime by `/api/ot/export/pdf` via `fs.readFile` from the
project root — no CDN dependency, no network call from the container.

**Rollback notes:**

- Schema changes are additive + nullable; rolling back to v1.32.x leaves
  the new columns harmless. The dropped `PENDING` enum label cannot be
  re-added cheaply, but no v1.32.x code path needs it after rollback —
  all previously-PENDING rows are now SUBMITTED, which v1.32.x reads
  as an unknown enum value (Prisma surfaces it as a generic string).
  If a rollback happens, do a one-time `UPDATE ot_records SET
  "approvalStatus" = 'APPROVED' WHERE ...` cleanup to absorb in-flight
  SUBMITTED rows; v1.32.x doesn't have a UI to action them.
- Deploy gate: merge `feat/ot-signature` → `main` triggers the GHCR
  auto-build. Stack 125 redeploy via the standard Portainer
  `git/redeploy` flow as in v1.32.2.

---

## 2026-05-24 · v1.32.2 deployed to production — all 4 Codex-review fixes live

**Deploy mechanics:**

- Stack 125 `IMAGE_TAG` updated `sha-22a805a` (v1.31.1) → `sha-4441b50` (v1.32.2)
  via Portainer REST API (`PUT /api/stacks/125/git/redeploy?endpointId=2`,
  `pullImage:true`, `repositoryReferenceName:'refs/heads/main'`).
- Container rebuild took ~70s end-to-end (pull image + `prisma db push` +
  backfill SQL + `next start`).
- `production-booking-app` came up clean. No restart loop.

**Schema migration applied automatically by start.sh:**

- Added enum `CalendarSyncStatus { PENDING, OK, FAILED }`.
- Added 3 nullable columns on `bookings` table — no data touched.
- Backfill block updated all 4 existing CONFIRMED bookings to
  `calendarSyncStatus='OK'` (all had valid `calendarEventId`).

**Verified live on `https://probook.xtec9.xyz` after deploy:**

1. `/api/health` returns `200 ok:true`, `version:"1.32.2"`. All 4 checks
   green — db (51ms / 22 bookings), googleCalendarDwd (557ms / "THE
   STANDARD Production Bookings"), producerDashboardSheetWrite (1043ms),
   producerDashboardSheetRead (792ms).
2. `/admin/health` UI — Codex's two-auth-models legend renders. Amber
   warning under Calendar section confirms `impersonateSource:
   "hardcoded-fallback"` is being announced visibly (v1.32.4).
3. `/admin?status=CONFIRMED` — all 4 legacy CONFIRMED bookings have
   `calendarSyncStatus:'OK'` (backfill ran). No FAILED rows.
4. `/admin/[id]` for `AGN-260527-STD-01` (known-good booking) — new
   `<BookingConfirmedCard>` renders: "Sync OK · last checked Xm ago",
   "Calendar event · ID: nbm2s4secmf3a8gpt7icd4rttk · Open in Calendar",
   guest verification block shows "Assigned crew (1) · Calendar guests
   (1) · ✓ All 1 crew is on the calendar", Re-sync button present.

**Outcome:** All 4 Codex-review issues closed in production. No rollback
needed. Next deploy can re-use `sha-22a805a` as a known-good rollback
target — the 3 new DB columns are nullable so old code ignores them.

---

## 2026-05-24 · calendarSyncStatus + guest verification + impersonate fallback warning (v1.32.2) — schema change (additive)

**Scope:** Three remaining Codex-review fixes bundled — adds DB
visibility for async calendar sync state, live guest-list verification
on the booking detail page, and a visible warning when DWD impersonate
is falling back to the hardcoded default.

**Schema change (additive, safe):**

- New enum `CalendarSyncStatus { PENDING, OK, FAILED }`
- Three new nullable columns on `bookings`:
  `calendarSyncStatus`, `calendarSyncError`, `calendarLastSyncedAt`
- Applied via existing `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` in start.sh.
  No existing data touched.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image tagged `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env unchanged.
- `start.sh` will run the new prisma db push → 3 new columns created.
- Then runs the v1.32.2 backfill block — every CONFIRMED booking gets
  `calendarSyncStatus='OK'` if it has an event id, `'FAILED'` if not.
  Idempotent; guarded by `WHERE calendarSyncStatus IS NULL`.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. `/admin` — confirmed booking cards show the new sync status chip
   (no chip / green link if OK, red chip if FAILED, gray spinner if
   approve is in flight). Cards with broken sync show the error in
   the tooltip + a Re-sync button.
2. Approve a new booking → card shows "Calendar sync pending…"
   immediately, flips to green within 1-3s once background task
   completes. If you break DWD intentionally (unset env temporarily),
   it flips to red with the real error and the 10-min reconciler
   self-heals once the env is restored.
3. `/admin/[id]` for any CONFIRMED booking — shows the new
   `<BookingConfirmedCard>` with sync badge, calendar event link,
   live attendee diff (assigned vs actual), and Re-sync button.
4. `/admin/health` — amber warning under Google Calendar section if
   the impersonate is using the hardcoded fallback. Source badge
   shows `env` (green) or `hardcoded fallback` (amber).
5. AuditLog grows `calendar.approve_failed`,
   `calendar.impersonate_fallback_in_use`, and existing
   `calendar.reconcile_*` rows.

**Rollback trigger:** any regression in approve / assign / reconcile
behavior. Revert to `sha-a1ec653` (v1.32.1); the 3 new DB columns stay
(harmless, ignored by old code).

**Files changed:**

## 2026-05-24 · /api/health auth pattern fix (v1.32.1) — false-alarm fix

**Scope:** `/admin/health` was showing `unauthorized_client` on
Calendar + Sheets checks even though real booking flows were green
(Codex review of booking `AGN-260527-STD-01`). Root cause: the health
endpoint was using mismatched scope + impersonate combinations
compared to the real production code paths. False alarm.

**Portainer redeploy notes:** purely additive. No env / schema /
infra change. After redeploy, `/admin/health` should turn all green
on prod.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. `/admin/health` shows 4 live checks (DB + Calendar DWD + Sheets
   WRITE + Sheets READ), each labeled with the auth model exercised.
2. All 4 green on prod (proves the health page now accurately
   reflects what booking flows actually do).
3. If any row goes red post-deploy, the row label tells you which
   auth model has the problem (e.g. "Sheets WRITE failed" → service
   account access to the sheet was revoked; "Calendar DWD failed" →
   GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT or DWD grant issue).

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — exported `getCalendarAuth()`.
- `src/lib/google-sheets.ts` — exported `getSheetsWriteAuth()` +
  `getSheetsReadAuth()`.
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` — uses new helpers + 3 distinct checks.
- `src/app/admin/health/page.tsx` — relabeled + legend.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-24 · Proposed GHA post-build smoke test (v1.32.0) — needs manual apply

**Scope:** Proposed `smoke-test` job for
`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` that boots the just-built image
against a throwaway Postgres and polls `/login` until ready. Catches
startup-time regressions before operator pulls in Portainer.

**⚠ Not yet applied to the workflow file:** the agent's GitHub PAT
lacks `workflow` scope, so direct edits to `.github/workflows/*.yml`
are rejected. Full YAML is at `docs/gha-smoke-test.yml.proposed`
with copy-paste-into-GitHub-UI instructions. Apply once via the
web UI (one-time, ~2 min) and it's done.

**Portainer redeploy notes:** none — this is a CI change only. The
running stack is unaffected.

**Files changed:**

- `docs/gha-smoke-test.yml.proposed` (new — full job YAML to paste).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-24 · Cleanup + docs (v1.31.1) — no infra change, hygiene only

**Scope:** ESLint config so `npm run lint` works, new
`docs/architecture.md` + `docs/runbook-backup.md` for onboarding +
disaster recovery, legacy `/booking/[outlet]` route converted to a
redirect. No app behavior change.

**Portainer redeploy notes:** purely additive. Stack env unchanged.
Pull `sha-<this-commit>` if you want the cleanup; nothing breaks if
you don't.

**Files changed:**

- `.eslintrc.json` (new).
- `docs/architecture.md` (new — read this first when onboarding).
- `docs/runbook-backup.md` (new — backup PLAN; action items at the
  bottom for the human to actually wire up).
- `src/app/booking/[outlet]/page.tsx` — 400 lines → 10-line redirect
  to `/new`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-24 · TEAM roster → DB + /admin/team CRUD (v1.31.0) — schema change (additive)

**Scope:** Move crew assignment roster from hardcoded `TEAM` constant
in `src/app/admin/[id]/page.tsx` to a new Prisma table `team_members`,
with a CRUD admin page at `/admin/team`. Adds 1 new table; no changes
to existing tables. Calendar / booking / approve / assign flows
unchanged.

**Heads-up — schema change:**

- New table `team_members` added via `prisma db push` (run
  automatically by `start.sh` on container start). No data loss
  because the table is new; existing tables untouched.
- `prisma/seed.ts` inserts 26 initial members from
  `src/lib/team-roster.ts` (matches the old hardcoded `TEAM` constant
  exactly) — only inserts rows missing from the DB, so subsequent
  seed runs preserve admin edits.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env unchanged from v1.30.0.
- After redeploy:
  1. Container log should show
     `==> Syncing database schema...` (db push) → new table created.
  2. Then `==> Seeding database (idempotent)...` →
     `✓ team_members: 26 inserted, 0 already present` on the first run.
     Subsequent runs print `0 inserted, 26 already present`.
- `/admin/team` should show 7 role sections (Producer / Coordinator,
  Videographer, Video Director, Sound Team, Photographer, Switcher,
  Virtual Production) with the seeded members.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. Open `/admin/team`. 7 sections render with 26 total members.
2. Click Edit on any member → change display name → Save. Page
   refreshes; new name visible.
3. Open `/admin/[id]` for any REQUESTED booking. The "Assign crew"
   section shows the same roster, including your edited name.
4. Deactivate a member at `/admin/team`. Re-open `/admin/[id]`. The
   deactivated member no longer appears in assign UI; historical
   bookings that already had them assigned still show their email.
5. Toggle "Show inactive" on `/admin/team` → deactivated member
   reappears with an amber `inactive` chip and a Re-activate button.

**Rollback trigger:** if `/admin/team` or `/admin/[id]` assign UI
breaks. Revert to `sha-631292f` (v1.30.0); the `team_members` table
stays in the DB (harmless), the code reverts to reading the hardcoded
`TEAM` constant.

**Files changed:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — added `TeamMember` model.
- `prisma/seed.ts` — added team_members seed loop.
- `src/lib/team-roster.ts` (new) — RosterRole type, ROLE_ORDER,
  ROLE_LABEL, INITIAL_TEAM_ROSTER seed data, groupByRole helper.
- `src/app/api/admin/team/route.ts` (new) — GET list, POST create.
- `src/app/api/admin/team/[id]/route.ts` (new) — PATCH update, DELETE soft-delete.
- `src/app/admin/team/page.tsx` (new) — CRUD UI.
- `src/app/admin/[id]/page.tsx` — removed hardcoded TEAM, fetches from
  API with INITIAL_TEAM_ROSTER fallback.
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` — added Team link in header.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-24 · Sheet config consolidation + /admin/health (v1.30.0) — no infra change, infrastructure for sandbox↔prod sheet swap

**Scope:** Internal-tooling release that paves the way for switching
the Producer Dashboard sheet from sandbox to a real production sheet
without code changes or surprises.

**What admins gain:**

- `/admin/health` — new page (linked from `/admin` header next to
  Permissions). Shows runtime config (sheet ids masked) plus live
  round-trip checks to the DB, Google Calendar, and Producer Dashboard
  sheet. Use it after every deploy / env change to confirm the
  container is actually pointed where you intended.
- Big amber **SANDBOX** banner on `/admin/health` when the deploy is
  using the fallback sheet id — impossible to miss before going live.
- `docs/runbook-sheet-swap.md` — checklist for the swap.

**What changed internally:**

- `src/lib/google-config.ts` — new single source of truth for the
  Producer Dashboard sheet id. The previously-duplicated
  `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_SHEET_ID` in google-sheets.ts / projects.ts /
  people.ts / dashboard-episodes.ts is gone; all four now call
  `getProducerDashboardSheetId()`.
- `GET /api/health` — admin-only diagnostic endpoint that the
  `/admin/health` page consumes.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env unchanged from v1.29.4.
- No DB migration, no port change, no worker change.
- After deploy, hit `/admin/health` — confirm sheet section shows
  current config (masked) and live checks are green.

**Verification:**

1. Open `/admin/health` while signed in as admin. Page renders.
2. Top-line status reads "All systems operational" (green check).
3. Producer Dashboard sheet section shows:
   - Sheet ID (masked, e.g. `1rMLmQ…lARw`).
   - Source: `env`.
   - Mode: `✓ Production` (or `⚠ SANDBOX` if env unset — that's the
     banner up top).
4. Live checks all green:
   - Database — returns booking count.
   - Google Calendar — returns calendar title.
   - Producer Dashboard sheet — returns sheet title + tab list.
5. Click Re-check button — same response in ~200–500ms.

**Production sheet swap procedure** (when ready): see
`docs/runbook-sheet-swap.md`. Summary:

1. Share new sheet with service account
   `production-booking@production-booking-494605.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   (Editor).
2. In Portainer stack env, set `PRODUCER_DASHBOARD_SHEET_ID` to the
   new id, Save settings, Pull and redeploy.
3. Verify on `/admin/health`: amber SANDBOX warning gone, sheet title
   updated, live check green.
4. Smoke-test with a CA booking.

**Rollback trigger:** none expected — this release is purely additive.
If `/admin/health` itself misbehaves, revert to `sha-4a9b5a9`
(v1.29.4); the underlying calendar fix stays.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/google-config.ts` (new) — sheet config helpers.
- `src/lib/google-sheets.ts`, `src/lib/projects.ts`, `src/lib/people.ts`,
  `src/lib/dashboard-episodes.ts` — switched to shared helpers.
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` (new) — admin-only diagnostic endpoint.
- `src/app/admin/health/page.tsx` (new) — UI dashboard.
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` — added Health link in header.
- `docs/runbook-sheet-swap.md` (new) — swap procedure.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-24 · Hardcoded impersonate fallback (v1.29.4) — fix for stale-compose deploy

**Scope:** Defensive bug fix for the long-running "calendar guests not
added" issue. After v1.29.3 made the real error message visible, live
diagnosis via Portainer + Google Admin confirmed:

1. ✓ Service account creds set in stack env.
2. ✓ Google Admin DWD granted for client `106117530552798836735` with
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (full r/w).
3. ✓ Shared calendar "THE STANDARD Production Bookings" shared with
   `narasit.k@thestandard.co` with "Make changes and manage sharing".
4. ✓ Stack env editor shows `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT=
   narasit.k@thestandard.co`.
5. ❌ **Running container `process.env.GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT`
   is undefined.**

Root cause: Portainer is Repository-mode, and the box's git fetch has
been failing intermittently — Portainer keeps reusing a stale cached
`docker-compose.portainer.yml` that pre-dates v1.26.4's
`${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT:-narasit.k@thestandard.co}` default. Stack
env edits never reach the container because the cached compose has no
`GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT:` line under the `environment:` block at all.

**Fix:** code-level fallback in `src/lib/google-calendar.ts`. The
`getCalendarImpersonateSubject()` helper now returns
`narasit.k@thestandard.co` (the same default that's already in the
Portainer compose) when the env var is missing/empty, with a
one-time-per-process warning logged to the container log. Env var still
wins when set.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env unchanged.
- No DB migration. No worker change.
- After deploy:
  1. Container log's first calendar-related line should be
     `[calendar] GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT env not set — using built-in
     fallback "narasit.k@thestandard.co" so DWD still works.` (or no
     line at all if a future Portainer redeploy successfully sets the
     env var — in which case the line is silenced, also fine.)
  2. On `/admin`, Re-sync the two known-bad bookings
     (PP-26-001-L01, PP-26-006-L01) — chips must turn green
     "✓ event created with N guests".
  3. Open the THE STANDARD Production Bookings calendar in Google
     Calendar — the new events should appear with the assigned crew
     as guests.

**Follow-up — fix Portainer's stale compose (separately):**

- Investigate why `Failed to fetch latest commit id of the stack 125`
  appeared in Portainer Notifications. Likely DNS or outbound network
  issue from the Portainer host to github.com. Verify with
  `docker exec portainer wget -O- https://github.com/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking`.
- Once git fetch works, "Pull and redeploy" will refresh the compose
  and the env var will flow naturally. The code-level fallback can
  stay as a safety net.

**Rollback trigger:** none expected. The fallback only activates when
the env is missing, which currently is the only known state. Reverting
to `sha-9041ff5` (v1.29.3) brings back the diagnostic surface but not
the fix.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — `DEFAULT_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` constant,
  `getCalendarImpersonateSubject()` falls back with a one-time warning.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Surface real createCalendarEvent reason (v1.29.3) — diagnostic fix

**Scope:** Bug fix. v1.29.2 added the Re-sync button + result chip, but
the chip read "createCalendarEvent returned null" on the two affected
bookings — useful only insofar as it confirmed the call failed.
v1.29.3 changes `createCalendarEvent` to throw specific errors instead
of silently returning null, so the chip carries the *actual* reason.

**What admins will see after redeploy:**

- Re-sync on the same booking now returns one of:
  - `⚠ GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT not set (or env value is empty after
    trim) — Domain-Wide Delegation is required …` → fix the Portainer
    env var.
  - `⚠ Google Calendar rejected event create with attendees: <upstream
    Google error>` → DWD scope drift / impersonated user lost calendar
    access / quota — investigate based on the upstream text.
  - `⚠ Google service account not configured — set
    GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON …` → missing creds in the stack env.
  - `✓ event created with N guests` → it worked this time; the prior
    failure was transient.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env unchanged. No DB migration.
- After deploy, Re-sync the two affected bookings (Content Agency
  Short Clip PP-26-001-L01, Content Agency Long Form PP-26-006-L01).
  The new chip will tell you exactly what's wrong. Most likely
  candidate based on the symptom: `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` is set
  but has a trailing newline OR is set to a user that no longer has
  calendar access OR DWD was revoked.

**Verification:**

1. Re-sync the two known-bad bookings → chip carries a specific reason
   (not "returned null").
2. Fix the reason in Portainer env → redeploy → Re-sync again → chip
   turns green with `✓ event created with N guests`.
3. `AuditLog action='calendar.invite_failed'` rows for these bookings
   now include the same human-readable message in the `changes.error`
   field.

**Rollback trigger:** none expected — purely improves error messages.
Revert to `sha-196fd68` (v1.29.2) if anything regresses.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — throw with specific message instead
  of silent `return null` on known failure paths; re-throw in the
  outer catch.
- `src/lib/calendar-reconcile.ts` — friendlier message on the
  defensive null fallback.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Calendar status + Re-sync button on /admin (v1.29.2) — visibility fix

**Scope:** UI + endpoint for admins. No background worker / approve /
assign behavior change. Reaction to an ops report that a CONFIRMED
booking had no Google Calendar event and the admin had no way to see
*why* from inside the app.

**What changed for ops:**

1. Each CONFIRMED (and COMPLETED) booking card on `/admin` now shows
   either a blue "📅 Open in Calendar" link (when an event exists) or
   a red "⚠ No calendar event" chip (when it doesn't). No more guessing.
2. Every such card also gets a "Re-sync" button. Clicking it runs the
   exact same reconcile logic the background worker runs, but scoped to
   one booking and synchronous so the result appears inline:
   `✓ event created with 1 guest`, `✓ guests updated (3)`,
   `✓ already in sync`, or `⚠ <reason>`. No more waiting up to 10
   minutes for the worker tick.
3. The on-screen reason for a calendar failure (DWD off, Google API
   rejected, etc.) is now the *first place* admins see the diagnostic,
   instead of having to SSH in to read container logs or query
   `AuditLog`.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image tagged `sha-<this-commit>`. Stack env vars unchanged.
- No DB migration, no port change, no new worker process (still the
  one from v1.29.0).
- After deploy, re-open `/admin`, filter `CONFIRMED`, find the affected
  booking, click **Re-sync**. The inline result tells you what's wrong.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. The Content Agency · Long Form booking from the ops report now shows
   a calendar chip + Re-sync button. Clicking Re-sync either turns the
   chip green ("📅 Open in Calendar" + `✓ event created with 1 guest`)
   or shows the failure reason inline.
2. New entry under `AuditLog action='calendar.reconcile_*'` for that
   booking confirms the run executed.
3. Re-sync on a booking that's already in sync returns
   `✓ already in sync` and writes a `calendar.reconcile_patched`
   row (no-op patch, dryRun=false).

**Rollback trigger:** none expected — this is additive. If the
`calendar-resync` endpoint misbehaves, revert to `sha-106ab50`
(v1.29.1); the rest of the calendar fix chain stays.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/calendar-reconcile.ts` — extracted per-booking
  `processBooking()` + added `reconcileSingleBooking(bookingId)`
  export. Existing bulk worker behavior unchanged.
- `src/app/api/admin/[id]/calendar-resync/route.ts` (new) — admin-auth
  endpoint that triggers the per-booking reconcile.
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` — new `<CalendarStatus>` component on
  CONFIRMED/COMPLETED cards.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Reconciler hardening + Docker hygiene (v1.29.1) — operational fix, no behavior change

**Scope:** Dev-audit pass on v1.29.0's reconciler. Same feature surface —
the auto-reconciler still runs every 10 minutes, the strict
`requireAttendees` create path is unchanged, all AuditLog rows are
identical. This release hardens the worker against silent failure modes
and tightens the Docker build.

**What changed for ops:**

1. **Worker restarts itself.** `start.sh` now wraps
   `node scripts/calendar-reconcile-worker.js` in
   `while true; do …; sleep 5; done &`. A crash in the worker no longer
   leaves it dead for the container's lifetime.
2. **Worker logs config on boot.** First log line now reads e.g.
   `[calendar-reconcile] worker started; interval=600000ms;
   baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:3000; secret=set`. If `secret=MISSING`
   that's the smoking gun — the endpoint will 401 every poll.
3. **Worker exits cleanly on SIGTERM.** Container stop now takes
   ~instant instead of waiting for the SIGKILL grace period.
4. **NaN interval bug fixed.** A non-numeric value in
   `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` (e.g. someone typing `"10min"`)
   used to silently turn into NaN → setInterval clamped to ~1ms → busy
   loop hammering the internal endpoint. Now falls back to 600000.
5. **`/changelog` no longer breaks if `.dockerignore` evolves.** New
   inline comment in `.dockerignore` explicitly notes that
   `CHANGELOG.md` and `USER_MANUAL_TH.md` are read at runtime by the
   app and MUST stay in the image. Codex's draft had silently excluded
   them.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image tagged `sha-<this-commit>` from GHCR. Stack env vars
  unchanged from v1.29.0 — no compose edit required.
- After deploy, the container log's first reconcile-related line should
  be `[calendar-reconcile] worker started; interval=600000ms;
  baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:3000; secret=set`. If `secret=MISSING`,
  set `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_SECRET` (or just `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) in the
  stack env and redeploy.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. `docker logs <container>` shows the new worker startup line with
   `secret=set` and a non-NaN interval.
2. Kill the worker process inside the container (`docker exec ...
   pkill -f calendar-reconcile-worker`) — supervisor logs
   `supervisor: worker exited, restarting in 5s` and the new worker
   logs its startup line ~5s later. Web server stays up the whole time.
3. `docker stop <container>` exits in well under the 10-second default
   grace period (was previously stretching toward SIGKILL because the
   worker ignored SIGTERM).
4. `/changelog` page still renders the full CHANGELOG (regression
   check on the `.dockerignore` invariant).

**Rollback trigger:** none expected — this is purely defensive. If
needed, revert to `sha-c0c3e2f` (v1.29.0).

**Files changed:**

- `scripts/calendar-reconcile-worker.js` — NaN guard, startup log,
  SIGTERM handler, missing-secret warn.
- `start.sh` — supervisor loop around the worker.
- `.dockerignore` (NEW — committed; CHANGELOG.md and USER_MANUAL_TH.md
  deliberately stay in context).
- `.gitignore` — ignore `/backups`, `*.sql`, `*.dump`.
- `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.portainer.yml` — document the
  `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_URL` override knob.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Calendar guest auto-reconciler (v1.29.0) — **infra change: new background worker**

**Scope:** Layered on top of v1.28.2's synchronous-on-assign fix. After
v1.28.2 deployed, ops still observed transient guest-loss (DWD blip,
patch rejected mid-flight, etc.). This release adds an **automated
reconciliation loop** so guests heal without manual re-assign, plus a
stricter create path that refuses to ship a guest-less event when the
booking already has assigned crew.

**Heads-up — this release CHANGES THE CONTAINER:**

1. `start.sh` now spawns a second process inside the container —
   `node scripts/calendar-reconcile-worker.js &` — that runs every
   `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` (default 600000 = 10 min). It hits
   the new internal endpoint `GET /api/internal/calendar/reconcile`,
   which pulls confirmed bookings and reconciles guest drift.
2. The worker authenticates with a shared secret read from
   `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_SECRET` → `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` → `AUTH_SECRET`.
   The Portainer compose now sets both `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_SECRET` and
   `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` (with sensible defaults), so the
   stack works without explicitly setting either.
3. Background worker logs only when it actually changes something
   (e.g. `[calendar-reconcile] checked=23 ok=22 patched=1 created=0
   failed=0`). Silent runs by design.

**Portainer redeploy notes:**

- Pull image `sha-452857f` (Codex's build) or whatever the latest GHCR
  tag is after this commit, **plus** redeploy the stack so the new env
  vars from `docker-compose.portainer.yml` get applied. The container
  needs the new `CALENDAR_RECONCILE_*` env vars for the worker to auth
  against the internal endpoint.
- No DB migration. No new mounts. No port changes.
- Existing `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` env value should be checked —
  v1.29.0's `getCalendarImpersonateSubject()` trims trailing whitespace
  (which was silently disabling DWD before), but it doesn't fix a wrong
  value. If guests still don't appear after deploy, that's the first
  thing to inspect.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. Container logs on startup should include
   `[calendar-reconcile] worker started; interval=600000ms`.
2. ~30 seconds after start, the first reconcile fires. With no drift
   the log stays silent; with drift the worker logs one line per pass
   and writes `calendar.reconcile_*` rows to `AuditLog`.
3. **Force a drift test:** open a CONFIRMED booking in the DB, set its
   `calendarEventId` to NULL (or to a known-bad id) by hand, wait ~10
   min (or hit `GET /api/internal/calendar/reconcile?limit=10` directly
   while signed in as admin). Booking should get a new event with the
   right guests; `AuditLog action='calendar.reconcile_created'` (or
   `_recreated`) row should appear.
4. **Manual one-off run** (admin browser):
   `https://probook.xtec9.xyz/api/internal/calendar/reconcile?limit=50`
   returns JSON `{success, checked, ok, patched, created, failed,
   items}`. Use `dryRun=1` first if you want to preview without
   touching Google.
5. **Strict-create test:** approve a booking that has crew assigned
   while DWD is intentionally broken (temporarily change
   `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` to nonsense + restart). Approve should
   NOT create an empty event; admin UI should warn; `AuditLog
   action='calendar.invite_failed'` row should appear with
   `fallbackCreated: false`. Restore the env, redeploy.

**Rollback trigger:** if the reconciler creates duplicate events,
deletes legitimate guests, or thrashes Google API quotas — revert image
tag in Portainer to `sha-455b1af` (v1.28.2). The worker process simply
won't exist in the older image.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/calendar-reconcile.ts` (new) — reconciler core.
- `src/app/api/internal/calendar/reconcile/route.ts` (new) — worker
  endpoint.
- `scripts/calendar-reconcile-worker.js` (new) — background poller.
- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — strict `requireAttendees`, trimmed
  impersonation, Bangkok-aware datetime, `getCalendarEventAttendees`,
  improved `deleteCalendarEvent`.
- `src/app/api/admin/[id]/approve/route.ts`,
  `src/app/api/admin/[id]/assign/route.ts` — pass `requireAttendees`
  when crew is present, use `getCalendarImpersonateSubject()`.
- `start.sh` — spawn the worker.
- `docker-compose.portainer.yml` — new env vars.
- `docker-compose.yml` — parity with portainer compose (dev runs the
  same path).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump 1.28.2 → 1.29.0.

## 2026-05-23 · Calendar guest sync fix (v1.28.2) — no infra change, behavior fix

**Scope:** Bug fix for the "assigned crew not showing as Google Calendar
guests" regression. Touches one API route + one admin UI surface. No
schema migration, no env-var change, no other API breakage.

**Why this matters:** assign-without-guests is a silent failure mode that
crew only notice when they don't get the invite. Ops requested an
"automation" that adds guests immediately on assign and tells the admin
when it didn't work. That's now wired.

**What's different after redeploy:**

- `/admin/[id]` Assign action now BLOCKS for ~0.5–2s while the calendar
  guest patch (or auto-create) happens, instead of returning instantly
  and dropping the result. Admins should expect a slightly longer "Save"
  click on assign — that's the calendar sync running.
- Toast message after Save Assign now includes calendar status:
  `· calendar guests updated (N)` (existing event), `· calendar event
  auto-created with N guests` (race-recover), or `· ⚠ calendar guests
  NOT added (<reason>)`. Last form means follow-up needed.
- If `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` is missing/wrong (DWD off), the toast
  says so directly instead of going green. Was previously silently green.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. Approve any REQUESTED booking. Within 5 seconds, click Assign with 2+
   crew → toast must read `calendar event auto-created with N guests`.
   Open the event in Google Calendar → guests visible.
2. Assign on a CONFIRMED booking that already has a calendar event → toast
   reads `calendar guests updated (N)`. Event guest list reflects the new
   list (added crew get invite, removed crew get cancellation — same as
   v1.26.x behavior, just now reported in the UI).
3. Re-assign with same crew list → no-op patch, toast still `updated (N)`.
4. (Negative path) If you intentionally unset `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT`
   in Portainer env and redeploy → assign toast reads `⚠ calendar guests
   NOT added (GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT not set — cannot add calendar
   guests without Domain-Wide Delegation)`. Restore the env, redeploy.
5. Confirm `AuditLog` still gets `calendar.attendees_update_failed` rows
   on Google API errors — query `SELECT * FROM "AuditLog" WHERE action
   LIKE 'calendar.%' ORDER BY at DESC LIMIT 5`.

**Rollback trigger:** any regression in (a) the booking POST payload,
(b) approve's calendar event creation, (c) assignment email send, or
(d) Producer Dashboard sheet writes — revert image tag in Portainer to
`sha-46cf7ba` (v1.28.1).

**Files changed:**

- `src/app/api/admin/[id]/assign/route.ts` — sync calendar patch +
  auto-recover create branch + `calendarSync` in response.
- `src/app/admin/[id]/page.tsx` — toast includes calendar guest result;
  failed sync downgrades tone to warning.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Booking wizard step 4 reorder (v1.28.1) — no infra change

UI-only follow-up to v1.28.0: in the CA flow's Step 4 (People & Crew),
Project ID and Episodes now sit between Producer and Director so the
cascade reads top-to-bottom (Producer → Project → Episodes → Director →
Crew → Notes). No API/payload changes — pure JSX reorder.

**Files changed:**
- `src/app/_components/booking/BookingWizard.tsx`

---

## 2026-05-23 · Operations-console UI redesign (v1.28.0) — no infra change

**Scope:** UI/UX-only refactor across the user-facing surfaces. No schema
migration, no env-var change, no API breakage. Same Postgres rows, same
Google Calendar behavior, same email triggers, same Producer Dashboard
sync as v1.27.0. Safe to roll forward via the usual GHCR auto-build on
push to `fix/assign-email-real-results` / `main`; rollback is a plain
image revert in Portainer.

**What deploys can expect to see:**

- **`/` is no longer the booking form.** It is now an Overview page with
  KPI cards (Today / This week / Needs attention) and three lists
  (Today's schedule, My upcoming, Needs attention). The booking form
  moved to `/new`.
- A persistent **`+ New Booking`** button in the nav goes to `/new` from
  anywhere.
- The booking form is now a **5-step wizard** (Project → Schedule →
  Location → People & Crew → Review) with a sticky live summary on the
  right (desktop) and a fixed bottom action bar with collapsible summary
  (mobile). Submit only fires on the Review step's *Confirm & Submit*
  button — first-time returning users will likely notice the new flow.
- `/calendar` gets a Month/Agenda view toggle (auto-switches to Agenda
  on narrow viewports) and a slide-in detail drawer replaces the hover
  tooltip. Clicking any event opens the drawer.
- `/my-bookings` is now an inbox with **6 tabs** (Upcoming · Requested ·
  Assigned · Confirmed · Completed · Cancelled) and full-text search.
- App background is `#F6F7F9` (cool neutral) instead of `#F0EBF8` (light
  purple). Status pills, buttons, cards, and inputs all use the new
  8px-radius `.ops-*` primitives.

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. Open `/` while signed in → Overview page renders 3 KPI cards + 3 panels.
   Click *New Booking* → routes to `/new` (the wizard).
2. On `/new`:
   - Try to click *Next* on step 1 with nothing filled → red inline errors
     under each required field.
   - Pick a CA outlet (AGN) → Project ID + Episodes UI appears in step 4
     (was step 4 previously, location unchanged).
   - Walk through to step 5 (Review) → values populate; click *Edit* on
     any block → jumps back to the matching step.
   - *Confirm & Submit* on step 5 → existing success page; calendar invite
     fires with guests; Producer Dashboard sheet row appears (CA only).
   - On a phone-sized viewport: bottom action bar visible; tap *Summary*
     → expanded summary panel; tap *Next* → advances step.
3. `/calendar` → Month view loads by default on desktop; on mobile, Agenda
   view auto-selected. Click any event chip → drawer slides in
   (right-side on desktop, bottom sheet on mobile). Press Esc → drawer
   closes.
4. `/my-bookings` → 6 tabs with count chips. *Requested* tab is the queue
   for items awaiting coordinator action.
5. `/dashboard` (admin) → status colors match the rest of the app; donut
   includes ASSIGNED slice; status column in the table renders the new
   pill.
6. Confirm legacy pages still work: `/manual`, `/changelog`, `/login`,
   `/admin/*`, `/ot/*`, `/booking/success`. These deliberately still use
   the legacy `.gf-*` look — no visual regression intended there.

**Rollback trigger:** any regression in booking POST payload, calendar
event creation, Producer Dashboard sheet writes, or assignment email —
revert image tag in Portainer to v1.27.0.

**Files changed (UI only):**

- `tailwind.config.ts` — added `status-*` palette + `app` bg + `card`
  radius alias; safelisted dynamic status classes for purge.
- `src/app/globals.css` — added `.ops-*` primitives (card, input, label,
  button, tab, choice, table, empty). Legacy `.gf-*` kept.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — unchanged behavior; visual changes inherit
  through globals.css.
- `src/app/_components/Nav.tsx` — primary/secondary split, More
  dropdown, compact brand, active-route chip, new CTA destination
  (`/new`).
- `src/app/_components/StatusPill.tsx` — new shared component.
- `src/app/_components/booking/BookingWizard.tsx` — new wizard.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — replaced legacy booking-form-as-home with
  Overview.
- `src/app/new/page.tsx` — new route renders the wizard.
- `src/app/calendar/page.tsx` — view toggle, agenda list, detail drawer.
- `src/app/my-bookings/page.tsx` — inbox-style multi-tab.
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — refined chrome, status palette alignment,
  StatusPill in table.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json` — version bump.

## 2026-05-23 · Booking flow UX overhaul (v1.27.0) — no infra change

**Scope:** UI/UX-only refactor of the booking surfaces. No schema migration,
no env-var change, no API breakage. Same Postgres rows, same Google Calendar
behavior, same email triggers as v1.26.5. Safe to roll forward via the usual
GHCR auto-build on push to `fix/assign-email-real-results` / `main`; rollback
is a plain image revert in Portainer.

**What deploys can expect to see:**

- `/` now shows a stepped booking form (6 sections, then a Review step) and a
  step indicator (Fill → Review). Submit only fires on the Review step's
  *Confirm & Submit* button — first-time users will likely notice this.
- `/calendar` event labels now read like `10:00 · AGN · Talk Show` instead of
  `10:00 AGN·T`. Hover preview unchanged.
- Top nav has a persistent `+ New Booking` CTA + reordered links (Calendar,
  My Bookings, Producer, Dashboard, Admin). Secondary items (OT, คู่มือ,
  อัปเดต, Upload [DEV]) sit behind a divider.
- `/dashboard` is renamed *Admin Dashboard* with three labelled sections.
  Still admin-only (route gating unchanged).

**Verification after redeploy:**

1. Open `/`, click *Review* without filling anything → field-level red errors
   appear under each empty required field (no top-of-form-only error).
2. Fill a Content Agency booking → step 2 *Review* shows all values
   correctly → *Confirm & Submit* creates the booking → calendar invite still
   fires with guests (regression check on v1.26.5 monitoring).
3. Open `/calendar` → confirm event chips show the full program name and
   truncate gracefully on narrow days.
4. Verify nav: non-admins should see *Calendar · My Bookings* (+ Producer if
   they have a Producer role); admins additionally see *Dashboard · Admin*.

**Rollback trigger:** any regression in booking POST payload, calendar event
creation, or assignment email — revert image tag in Portainer to v1.26.5.

**Files changed (UI only):**

- `src/app/page.tsx` — booking form refactor + Review step.
- `src/app/calendar/page.tsx` — event chip readability.
- `src/app/_components/Nav.tsx` — primary/secondary nav split + persistent CTA.
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — admin dashboard sectioning.

## 2026-05-23 · Calendar invite failures now observable (v1.26.5)

**Background:** v1.26.4 made calendar guests work by defaulting
`GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` in compose. But the failure mode is still silent:
if DWD is revoked, the impersonate user loses calendar access, or the account
is disabled, `createCalendarEvent` falls back to creating the event WITHOUT
guests and only emits a `console.warn`. Operators would only notice once crew
started missing invites in the wild.

**What v1.26.5 adds (app-only, no compose change required):**

- AuditLog rows on every failure — queryable from the admin audit page, kept
  for 90 days. Actions: `calendar.invite_failed` (insert fallback) and
  `calendar.attendees_update_failed` (patch failure on re-assign). Payload
  includes `eventId`, attendees, error, and current `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT`.
- Email alert to an admin, using the existing `sendEmail` infra. Recipient
  resolves to `CALENDAR_ALERT_EMAIL` (new optional env var) → falls back to
  `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` → no-op if neither is set or no email provider
  is configured.

**New optional env var: `CALENDAR_ALERT_EMAIL`**

- **Default behavior (unset):** alerts go to `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT`
  (`narasit.k@thestandard.co`). No action needed.
- **Override:** set in the Portainer stack env if a different on-call address
  should receive alerts. Not added to `docker-compose.portainer.yml` because
  the fallback already covers the common case.

**How to verify post-deploy:**

1. Confirm the next confirmed booking with assigned crew still adds guests
   (regular success path — no AuditLog row, no email).
2. To exercise the alert path safely: temporarily set
   `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` to a real Workspace user **without** calendar
   access in a staging stack, approve a booking, then check `audit_logs` for
   `action = 'calendar.invite_failed'` and the admin inbox for the alert.

**Files changed:**

- `src/lib/google-calendar.ts` — new `notifyCalendarAlert` helper; wired into
  both failure points.
- `src/app/api/admin/[id]/approve/route.ts`,
  `src/app/api/admin/[id]/assign/route.ts` — pass `bookingCode` through so
  alerts identify the booking by its readable code.

## 2026-05-23 · Calendar guests FIXED — `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` was unset

**Symptom:** Approved bookings appear on the shared Google Calendar, but the
assigned crew are NOT added as guests (attendees) — only listed in the
description's "Assigned:" line.

**Root cause:** `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` is unset in the deployment env, so
`createCalendarEvent` computes `canInvite = false` and creates the event with an
empty attendee list. (A bare service account can't invite attendees — see the
v1.26.0 entry below.) The DWD grant from v1.26.0 was done, but the env var that
turns it on was never set, so the code silently skipped attendees. No error.

**Diagnosis (local DWD probe, service account creds from `.env`):**
- Bare service account + attendee → `403 forbiddenForServiceAccounts`
  ("Service accounts cannot invite attendees without Domain-Wide Delegation").
- Impersonating `narasit.k@thestandard.co` + attendee → **SUCCESS** (event
  created with the guest, then deleted). ⇒ DWD is already granted in Workspace
  and this subject has access to the shared calendar.

**Why the first idea (set a stack env var) didn't take:** `docker-compose.portainer.yml`
interpolated `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` from a *stack-level* env var
(`${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT:-}`). If it isn't added to the stack's
"Environment variables" — or the stack wasn't actually re-deployed — the
container gets an empty value and guests are silently skipped. A test redeploy
produced **no** calendar activity (no new event, no attendee update), confirming
the var never reached the container.

**Fix shipped (v1.26.4, deploy config — no app code change):**
1. **`docker-compose.portainer.yml`** → `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` now defaults
   to `narasit.k@thestandard.co`
   (`${GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT:-narasit.k@thestandard.co}`), so a redeploy
   enables guests with no stack env var to remember. A stack env var still
   overrides it.
2. Added the same line to local `.env` for parity.
3. **Retroactive backfill:** added guests to the 5 existing confirmed bookings
   that had crew in the "Assigned:" line but no attendees — impersonated
   `events.patch`, `sendUpdates:'none'` (no invite blast). Done from a local
   script using the SA key; no redeploy required for these.

Service account Client ID for DWD reference: `106117530552798836735`, scope
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.

**Remaining step (operator):** redeploy the Portainer stack so it picks up the
updated compose (pull `fix/assign-email-real-results` / the v1.26.4 image, then
**Update the stack**). After that, **new** approvals add guests automatically.

**Verify:** approve a booking that has assigned crew → the crew appear as guests
on the event (organizer becomes `narasit.k@thestandard.co`) and get an invite.

---

## 2026-05-22 · Calendar guests — Domain-Wide Delegation setup (v1.26.0)

To add assigned crew as real event guests (not just a description line), the
service account must impersonate a Workspace user (DWD) — a bare service account
can't invite attendees.

1. **GCP** → the service account → copy its **Client ID** ("Unique ID", a long
   number).
2. **Workspace Admin** → Security → Access and data control → **API controls** →
   **Domain-wide delegation** → Add new → Client ID = that ID, OAuth scope =
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
3. **Portainer stack env** → set `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SUBJECT` = a
   `@thestandard.co` user who can manage the shared calendar (e.g. the calendar
   owner / an admin). The service account acts as them → becomes the event
   organizer → can invite guests + send invites.
4. Redeploy.

**Without these:** the app logs a warning and creates the event **without**
guests (crew remain in the "Assigned:" description line) — no error, bookings
still work. So this is safe to ship before DWD is configured.

**Verify:** confirm a booking → the assigned crew should receive a Google
Calendar invite and appear as guests on the event.

---

## 2026-05-22 · Booking = Production (select existing episodes) + drop Episode @unique (v1.24.0)

Content Agency bookings no longer GENERATE episodes — they SELECT existing ones
(from the "_EPs" tab, Published excluded) and mint a **Production ID**
(`AGN-260423-EVT-01`). See CHANGELOG [1.24.0] for the full model.

**Schema change:** `Episode.episodeId` dropped its `@unique` constraint (an
episode can be shot in multiple Productions). `prisma db push --accept-data-loss`
on boot applies it — dropping a unique index is non-destructive (no data loss).

**No new env / no migration data step.** Episodes are read live from the sheet
(`_EPs`), so nothing to backfill. Nothing is written back to the `_EPs`/`PD`/`Dir`
episode rows — only the Bookings tab + DB.

**Verify after deploy:** book Content Agency → select project (e.g. Yamaha
`PP-26-006`) → the form lists `PP-26-006-L01`, `PP-26-006-S01` (Post-production),
NOT Published ones → multi-select → booking code becomes a Production ID like
`AGN-260522-EVT-01`, and the chosen episodes show on the booking.

---

## 2026-05-22 · Retire Apps Script Web App — project Episode IDs minted in-app (v1.22.0)

After the Web App's repeated operational failures (502 hang, env lost, then a
**dead deployment URL** — `…/AKfycbw2qiH…/exec` returned Google "ไม่พบเพจ"), we
removed the Apps Script dependency entirely. The app now mints
`PP-YY-NNN-{type}NN` IDs and writes the PD/Dir tabs itself via the Google
service account (`src/lib/dashboard-episodes.ts`).

**Required ops steps for this to be correct:**

1. **Service account edit access** — already in place (it writes the Bookings
   tab today), so no change needed.
2. **Disable the sheet's onEdit episode auto-gen trigger.** The app numbers from
   the producer's "PD &lt;producer&gt;" tab; the old onEdit used a separate
   `EP_SEQ` Script Property the app can't update. With booking now app-only the
   onEdit is dormant, but disable it so it can never fire and double-number.
3. The old `BOOKING_EPISODE_WEBAPP_URL` / `_SECRET` env are dead — can be
   removed from the Portainer stack (harmless if left).

**Verify after deploy:** create a project booking (e.g. Yamaha `PP-26-006`,
type T) → episodes should be `PP-26-006-T0N` and appear in "PD &lt;producer&gt;"
+ "Dir. &lt;director&gt;" tabs. If it errors `ออก Project ID ไม่ได้ (Dashboard:
…)`, the message says why (project not in All Projects / PD tab missing / sheet
unreachable).

**Numbering source of truth is now the PD tab** — old projects with hand-typed
episodes continue correctly with no migration (their episodes are already in the
PD tab, which the app scans for the max).

---

## 2026-05-22 · "AGN instead of PP" — Web App env lost + Episode-ID path simplified (v1.21.0)

**Symptom:** project-linked bookings (e.g. Yamaha `PP-26-006`) produced local
`AGN-260522-T-01..03` Episode IDs instead of `PP-26-006-T01..`.

**Root cause:** `BOOKING_EPISODE_WEBAPP_URL` / `BOOKING_EPISODE_WEBAPP_SECRET`
were **missing from the running container** (env lost during a redeploy — they
were documented as set at `sha-b597c3c` but didn't survive). The v1.20.0 silent
fallback then minted local IDs.

**Two-part fix:**

1. **Config (ops):** restore the two env vars in the Portainer stack — URL is in
   this log's "Where things live"; secret lives in the Apps Script Script
   Properties (`BOOKING_API_SECRET`). **Recreate the container** so they reach
   `process.env`. Verify:
   ```
   docker exec production-booking-app printenv | grep BOOKING_EPISODE
   ```
2. **Code (v1.21.0):** removed the silent fallback — a project booking now
   returns a clear `503` if the Web App is unreachable, instead of silently
   producing a wrong-format / out-of-sequence ID. Also removed the
   advisory-lock + retry scaffolding (over-engineered for the real load).

**Why the Web App stays:** the Dashboard sheet auto-generates Episode IDs via
its own onEdit trigger; the Web App keeps booking-created IDs in that **same
shared `EP_SEQ` sequence** and writes the PD/Dir tabs. The app cannot mint
project IDs locally without breaking that shared sequence — so for project
bookings the Web App is the single source, and "fail loud" beats "silent local".

**Guard against recurrence:** after any stack redeploy, confirm the env block
matches this log's "Env vars set in Portainer stack" — never blank the two
`BOOKING_EPISODE_*` vars.

---

## 2026-05-21 · Incident — booking POST 502 ("Unexpected token '<'") → fixed in v1.20.0

**Symptom:** Content Agency booking submit failed with `Unexpected token '<',
"<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`. After redeploy it became the v1.19.2 banner
"HTTP 502 — app restarting".

**Diagnosis (no app crash):**
- `GET /`, `POST /api/bookings` (unauth) → fast JSON every time (5/5 probes) →
  app stable, not crash-looping.
- App container logs: clean startup (`✓ Ready in 5.4s`), no error, no restart
  loop. So the POST was not throwing — it was **hanging**.
- 502 is from NPM (HTML body), i.e. NPM gave up waiting for the upstream.
- Sheet-backed routes (`/api/projects`, `/api/people`) worked; the differentiator
  on the failing path is the **Apps Script Web App** call for project-linked
  Episode IDs. The host has known IPv6-egress issues with Google
  (`NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first` in the compose), and an
  `AbortController` can't always interrupt a socket wedged in connect → the
  `await` hung → NPM 502.

**Fix (v1.20.0):**
- `requestEpisodeIds` now uses a `Promise.race` hard 12s timeout (not just
  AbortController) — guaranteed to return.
- The booking POST falls back to local Episode IDs when the Web App fails, so a
  Web App/Dashboard outage never blocks a booking (episodes get `AGN-…` IDs;
  `projectId` still saved). Logged via `console.warn`.

**Operational note:** during a Web App outage, watch
`docker logs production-booking-app | grep 'Web App unavailable'` to find
bookings that got local Episode IDs, in case they need re-issuing once the Web
App is healthy.

**Deploy:** image `sha-` of the v1.20.0 commit; standard Portainer re-pull +
recreate. No schema change.

## 2026-05-21 · Migration — bookingCode backfill + AuditLog table + 90-day retention

Adds an audit trail to every booking change and gives booking + episode a
shared human-readable ID. See `CHANGELOG.md` [1.18.0] for the full feature
list. This entry covers the operational concerns only.

### Schema delta

- `bookings.bookingCode` — new column, `TEXT NULL UNIQUE`
- `audit_logs` — new table (id, at, actorEmail, action, entityType, entityId,
  bookingCode, fromStatus, toStatus, changes JSONB) + four indexes

`prisma db push --accept-data-loss` handles both — additive change, no
existing column is dropped.

### Backfill (idempotent, post-push)

`start.sh` runs after `db push`:

```sql
UPDATE bookings b
   SET "bookingCode" = (
     SELECT e."episodeId" FROM episodes e
     WHERE e."bookingId" = b.id
     ORDER BY e.sequence ASC LIMIT 1
   )
 WHERE b."bookingCode" IS NULL;
```

`WHERE bookingCode IS NULL` makes it a no-op on second boot. Bookings with
zero episodes (shouldn't exist; defensive) keep `NULL` — `@unique` permits
multiple NULLs.

### Retention purge (90 days, every boot)

```sh
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "DELETE FROM audit_logs WHERE at < now() - INTERVAL '90 days'"
```

Non-fatal (`|| echo`) — failure on first boot before the table exists is
ignored. Can also be triggered manually by an admin via
`POST /api/audit/purge` without restarting the service.

### Pre-purge warning + CSV export

- Admins see a yellow banner on every admin page when there are rows in the
  14-day "warning window" (older than 76 days but younger than 90).
- The banner links to `/api/audit/export?from=…` which streams a UTF-8 CSV
  (BOM-prefixed; Excel opens Thai cleanly).
- The same banner load also fires an auto-email to every active admin
  (throttled ≤ once / 24 h via the `audit.auto_email_sent` marker row).

Email provider follows existing precedence
(`EMAIL_PROVIDER` → `RESEND_API_KEY` → `gmail-oauth` → SMTP); no new env vars
needed.

### Concurrency hardening

Local episode-sequence generation now takes a PostgreSQL advisory lock per
`(outlet, date, program)` slot inside the booking transaction
(`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(key, 0))`). Combined with a 3-try
retry on `P2002`, this makes 20-EP simultaneous bookings safe even on the
local generation path. Project-linked bookings already had this property
through the Producer Dashboard Web App counter — unchanged.

### Deploy checklist

- [ ] Build new image and push: `ghcr.io/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking:sha-<new>`
- [ ] Redeploy Portainer stack — `start.sh` runs the backfill + purge automatically
- [ ] Sanity: open `/admin` as an admin; expect bookings list to render (no banner
      yet because there's nothing in the warning window)
- [ ] Sanity: create a new booking with 2+ episodes; verify `bookingCode` in the
      DB equals `episodes[0].episodeId`
- [ ] Sanity: PATCH a booking status (e.g. `REQUESTED → ASSIGNED`); confirm
      `GET /api/bookings/:id/history` returns the `booking.status_change` row
- [ ] Sanity: hit `/api/audit/export` — should download a CSV with the BOM
      and at least the create + status-change rows from above

### Rollback path

If something breaks: revert the image tag in Portainer to `sha-<previous>`.
Schema change is additive (column + table), so the old code keeps working
against the new DB — no schema rollback needed unless we explicitly remove
the column/table.

## 2026-05-20 · Migration — Booking Category enum rename (in-place)

Renamed the `Category` enum values on `bookings.category` without dropping
data. Old → New: `RECURRING → ORIGINAL_CONTENT`, `AGENCY_JOB → ADVERTORIAL`,
`SERVICE_JOB → EVENT`, `INTERNAL` (unchanged).

### Migration mechanism

Added an idempotent `DO $$ ... $$` block to `start.sh` that runs **before**
`prisma db push --accept-data-loss`. It uses `ALTER TYPE "Category" RENAME
VALUE 'OLD' TO 'NEW'`, which mutates the enum type in place — existing rows
keep their data, no column drop/recreate, no `--accept-data-loss` collateral.

The block guards each rename with `pg_enum` existence checks, so it's safe to:
- Run on a fresh DB (the type doesn't exist yet — outer `pg_type` guard skips it)
- Run a second time after rollout (old labels are gone — inner checks skip)
- Roll back to v1.16.x if needed (the new enum values become "orphans" but
  `start.sh` would re-run on next boot of older code; only forward path tested)

### Deploy checklist

- [ ] Build new image: `ghcr.io/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking:sha-<new>`
- [ ] Redeploy Portainer stack — `start.sh` runs the SQL block automatically
- [ ] Verify `probook.xtec9.xyz` form shows new labels
- [ ] Spot-check existing bookings in admin — Category column should display
      "Original Content", "Advertorial", "Event", "Internal" via `categoryLabel()`

## 2026-05-20 · Sprint deploy — Episode-Type unification + sheet integration

Big push. `ghcr.io/narasitk77/thestandard-production-booking:sha-b597c3c`
is live on `probook.xtec9.xyz` (verified via root-page chunk fingerprint
`page-0ab30e59e376fc84.js`, HTTP 200, cache-busted).

### Shipped this sprint (oldest commit on top so the feature progression reads naturally)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `27615c2` | **Phase 1** — `projects.ts` column-mapping bug fix (was reading Client as Producer) + hide projects whose every episode on `_EPs` is `Published`. |
| `77dc985` | Standalone Apps Script Web App endpoint (`apps-script/booking-episode-endpoint.gs`) that ปุ๊ก / sheet owner drops in as a new file — no edits to existing trigger code. Only sharing the `EP_SEQ_*` ScriptProperties counter with `onEditEpisode`. |
| `1a4429b` | `bookingSeedCounters()` for the pilot copy — ScriptProperties don't carry over with File → Make a Copy, so the function scans PD tabs and seeds `EP_SEQ_<project>_<type>` to (max NN + 1). |
| `13a7dec` | **Phase 2** — booking app calls the Web App for project-linked bookings; `Booking.episodeType` is forwarded; sheet stays the single owner of Episode-ID numbering. |
| `07bc480` | **OT — per-person bulk approval.** `OTRecord.approvalStatus` enum + `/api/ot/admin/approve` route. UI shows amber "Approve N" button → green "✓ N" pill once signed off. |
| `876c8a7` | New-booking form gains `videographerCount` (1-10 next to the Videographer checkbox). Assign page gains a **Main Videographer (ช่างภาพหลัก)** picker. |
| `f4df207` | `bookingBackfillDirStatus()` — fixes the "ดึงข้อมูลได้บ้างไม่ได้บ้าง" gap in the pilot's Dir-tab Status column (event-sync triggers don't carry over with Make a Copy). |
| `f04f8bc` | (intermediate) Episode Type doubles as Program for Content Agency + Project. |
| `415ddbf` | Main Videographer picker restricted to assignees that are in `TEAM.video` (was listing every assigned email). |
| `bf9c7b9` | Project dropdown filters by the selected Producer — pick ไนซ์ → see only ไนซ์'s projects; switching Producer resets Project + Episode Type so a stale pick can't carry over. |
| `b597c3c` | **Form simplification — universal Episode Type.** Program → Episode Type for every outlet (L / S / A / T with descriptive Thai labels). Removes the separate AGN+Project picker. Shoot Type drops "Remote / Online". Location custom input accepts a Google Maps link. CREATIVE / HOST → **แขก / SUBJECT**. |

### Env vars set in Portainer stack (booking-relevant)

```
PRODUCER_DASHBOARD_SHEET_ID    = 1rMLmQIS237UDKLtTjTP0IC9pZ_4eWn4FxiTG0XflARw
BOOKING_EPISODE_WEBAPP_URL     = https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw2qi.../exec
BOOKING_EPISODE_WEBAPP_SECRET  = <set; secret stored only in Portainer + Apps Script>
IMAGE_TAG                      = sha-b597c3c
```

### Deploy cadence note

Each push to `main` builds `sha-<commit>` + retags `latest` (workflow:
`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`). Portainer does NOT auto-redeploy
on push — you must bump `IMAGE_TAG` to the new sha and check "Re-pull
image and redeploy" in **Update the stack**. The Portainer "fetch git
refs" warning during this step is non-blocking — the image pull goes
through `ghcr.io` directly.

## 2026-05-20 · Docker host DNS — `ghcr.io` unresolvable   ✅ RESOLVED

**Symptom (Portainer notification):**

```
Failed to pull images of the stack: compose pull operation failed:
Error response from daemon:
Get "https://ghcr.io/v2/": dial tcp: lookup ghcr.io on 192.168.21.221:53:
no such host
```

Plus a recurring warning from the same DNS box:

```
Failed to fetch latest commit id of the stack 125: failed to list
repository refs: Get ".../info/refs?service=git-upload-pack":
dial tcp: lookup github.com on 127.0.0.11:53: server misbehaving
```

**Impact while open**

The IMAGE_TAG bump from `sha-bf9c7b9` to `sha-b597c3c` was blocked —
the Docker daemon itself couldn't resolve `ghcr.io` to pull the image.
Stack stayed on the previous tag (cached locally on the host).

**Root cause**

The LAN DNS server at `192.168.21.221` was not resolving external
hostnames. Both the Docker daemon (directly) and the Portainer
container (via Docker's embedded resolver `127.0.0.11`) forward to
it, so both saw failures.

**Fix applied**

SSH'd to `192.168.21.220` and patched `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to
bypass the broken LAN DNS:

```json
{ "dns": ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"] }
```

Followed by `sudo systemctl restart docker`. After restart, the
daemon resolves external hostnames directly via Cloudflare/Google
DNS, and Portainer "Update the stack" with re-pull succeeded.

**If this happens again** — same fix. The `daemon.json` change is
persistent across reboots; if it's somehow reverted, re-apply.

## 2026-05-20 · Pilot Dashboard sheet — `Anyone with link can edit`   🟡 STILL OPEN

The pilot copy `1rMLmQIS237UDKLtTjTP0IC9pZ_4eWn4FxiTG0XflARw` is shared
with public-write (`{type:anyone, role:writer}`). This works for the
booking app's service account (it's covered by "anyone"), but anyone
who learns the sheet ID can rewrite the data.

**Fix to apply at convenience**

Open the sheet → Share → switch General access from "Anyone with the
link" to "Restricted" → add the service-account email (the value of
`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` in Portainer stack env) as Editor.

**Status: still open** — flagged but not yet fixed. App will keep
working after this change since the service account remains an
Editor; only public unauthenticated edits get cut off.

## 2026-05-20 · Apps Script Web App — curl redirect quirk on POST   ✅ RESOLVED

When the Web App was first deployed, `curl -L -X POST` against
`/exec` returned a Google Drive "ไม่พบเพจ" 404 page even with
`Anyone` access set correctly. Switching the client to Node `fetch`
(what the booking app uses in production) returned the expected
JSON immediately.

Root cause was the way curl follows the Apps Script POST 302 redirect
chain to `script.googleusercontent.com/macros/echo?user_content_key=...` —
the followed request loses the POST method/body. Not an Apps Script
problem and not a deployment problem.

**Verified working** via Node fetch with three safe tests:

| Test | Response |
|---|---|
| Wrong secret | `{ok:false, error:"unauthorized"}` |
| Right secret + bad type | `{ok:false, error:"bad type — expect L, S, A or T"}` |
| Right secret + bad projectId | `{ok:false, error:"bad projectId (expect PP-YY-NNN)"}` |

## Known follow-ups (cross-cutting)

- **Orphaned `/booking/[outlet]` form** (`src/app/booking/[outlet]/page.tsx`)
  is unlinked from any nav and bypasses every recent improvement
  (Producer/Director conditional, required Shoot End Date, Episode Type,
  Web App integration, ...). Flagged earlier in this conversation via a
  spawn_task chip. Decide whether to delete or redirect to `/`.

- **`production-management` (Panu)** — repo at
  `https://github.com/Panu-PookenZ/production-management` is private and
  was raised by the user but never accessed. Future integration to be
  scoped if/when the user wants to bring that system into the same data
  spine as this app.
